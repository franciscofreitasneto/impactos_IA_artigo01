However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity. © 2024 IEEE.","generative artificial intelligence; Higher education; learning process","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Generative adversarial networks; Students; Advanced systems; Artificial intelligence tools; Critical thinking; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Higher education students; Information search; Learning process; Research approach; Text images; Contrastive Learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213295087"

The purpose of this study is to examine the digital competences students need to develop in order to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools for learning purposes. We conducted 34 semi-structured interviews with 17 secondary school teachers in an interval of half a year, and triangulated these self-report data with an analysis of actual learning activities. During the interviews, the participants reported the digital competences their students develop using GenAI tools, and the skills they should practice. The digital competences were analyzed based on the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens 2.2 (DigComp 2.2) [8] that includes five main areas: Information and data literacy; Communication and collaboration; Digital content creation; Safety; and Problem solving. Despite DigComp 2.2's comprehensiveness, its pre-GenAI era foundation necessitates updates to fully address competences needed for GenAI use. The study findings indicate that the utilization of GenAI tools requires proficiency in all DigComp 2.2 domains. Importantly, employing GenAI tools calls for the expansion regarding the ability to analyze the pros and cons of AI tools, and the user's ability to choose GenAI tools that are appropriate for a given task. The findings suggest refining the framework's explanation regarding prompt-writing skills and adding the skill of managing ongoing dialogue with GenAI tools.

This is seen in written, oral, and visual methods of communication. For educational degree programs such as graphic communication programs, like those found at Clemson and Cal Poly, this is a difficult technology advancement to navigate. Previously, these programs have been a home for creative students’ hopeful to pursue a career in a science and creative communication field within the printing or digital media industries. New technology integrating into the classroom daily such as Chat GPT, Adobe Firefly, and Midjourney are quickly changing the education landscape. This leaves students and educators left to answer the questions of how to adapt these new technologies into the classroom and if it should be part of a formal education program. The first step in making these informed decisions is to better understand the attitudes, apprehensions, and level of comfort of students in Clemson and Cal Poly degree programs toward generative AI systems. To collect metrics on these attitudes, a five–point Likert Scale survey that was distributed to students enrolled in Clemson and Cal Poly graphic communication programs has been formulated. The data collected provided clarity that students have a high level of ethical apprehension toward generative AI systems despite adopting the technology in their everyday lives.

This research conducted two sub-studies aimed at exploring the influences and differences in college students’ attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence across the dimensions of gender, major, and experience. The first sub-study developed a scale based on the Expectancy-Value Theory to measure college students’ attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence, confirming the scale’s validity and reliability. The second sub-study analyzed attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence among 713 undergraduate students. The results revealed significant differences in undergraduate students’ attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence based on gender, major, and experience. Female students and those with experience in generative artificial intelligence showed more positive attitudes compared to male students and those without generative artificial intelligence experience. Notably, students majoring in Education scored significantly higher on generative artificial intelligence attitudes than students from other majors. Regression analysis further indicated that gender, discipline, and experience significantly predicted attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence. Students from different academic backgrounds exhibited significant gender and experience differences in their attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence within their respective majors. These findings underscore the necessity for educational strategies that consider gender, experience, and disciplinary backgrounds. It is crucial to provide all students with ample opportunities to engage with generative artificial intelligence to ensure gender equity in artificial intelligence education. Educators must design differentiated and inclusive generative artificial intelligence education activities and strategies tailored to specific disciplines to meet diverse student needs and accommodate disciplinary variations.

Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; Higher education; Learning and teaching","Academic integrity; Australia; Best practices; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Learning and teachings; Teaching staff; Technological development; Thematic analysis; Artificial intelligence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190520195"

A pre-trained LLM model is fine-tuned on preprocessed training rubrics and transcripts, allowing it to adapt to specific language patterns and structures. The model generates prompts to classify training materials based on predefined criteria, with domain expertise incorporated for complex evaluation rules. Results demonstrate a 60% reduction in processing time for evaluating rubrics and transcripts compared to manual assessment. The implemented model has significantly reduced the workload of the training department and improved the efficiency of data analysis. Furthermore, the model's feedback has led to targeted improvements in training content, resulting in higher learner satisfaction.

This paper reports on a survey of 371 US college students taking computing courses. We first asked what services are being used, how much they are paying for them, what they are using them for, and how long they have been using AI. We dig further into their use of AI tools in their schoolwork by asking about what subjects they use AI for, what they use AI for, and what causes them to not use it. Turning to their computing courses, we determine their use of AI, how useful they find AI tools, how they ensure academic integrity, and how they characterize their computing courses' framing of the use of AI tools. We found that the majority of students pay for GenAI tools despite readily available free versions. Students use GenAI tools primarily to understand jargon, such as understanding teacher-written programming assignment prompts and developer-written compiler messages as opposed to potentially problematic uses such as generating code. In fact, students' main motivation to not use GenAI tools on graded assignments was they like to do their own work. Notably, students who were taught how AI works had significantly different views on AI tools' impact on academic integrity concerns. Computing students' use of Generative AI is growing, and thoughts on academic integrity are far from decided - but there does seem to be an opportunity to teach students the variety of ways it can be used effectively for programming tasks. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Curricula; Engineering education; Program compilers; Teaching; Academic integrity; College students; Computing course; Graded assignments; Learning context; Programming assignments; Programming tasks; Teachers'; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202023427"

Methods: Internal medicine attendings and residents from two academic medical centers were given a clinical vignette and instructed to write a PR. Deductive content analysis described the characteristics comprising each PR. Individual PRs were input into ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI, September 2023) which was prompted to generate a ranked three-item differential. The ranked differential and the top-ranked diagnosis were scored on a 3-part scale, ranging from incorrect, partially correct, to correct. Logistic regression evaluated individual PR characteristic's impact on ChatGPT accuracy. Results: For a three-item differential, accuracy was associated with including fewer comorbidities (OR 0.57, p=0.010), fewer past historical items (OR 0.60, p=0.019), and more physical examination items (OR 1.66, p=0.015). For ChatGPT's ability to rank the true diagnosis as the single-best diagnosis, utilizing temporal semantic qualifiers, more semantic qualifiers overall, and adhering to a typical 3-part PR format all correlated with diagnostic accuracy: OR 3.447, p=0.046; OR 1.300, p=0.005; OR 3.577, p=0.020, respectively. Conclusions: Several distinct PR factors improved ChatGPT diagnostic accuracy. These factors have previously been associated with expertise in creating PR.

We find that the platform opts for a relatively low regulatory strength when the AI intelligence is relatively small. Interestingly, as generative AI acquires a more extensive knowledge base, the platform and creators may be less willing to adopt it. Moreover, our results show that creators' creativity level experiences a decline compared to the regime with such tools.

Its output includes text, code, image, audio, speech, voice, music, and video. Therefore, it impacts education courses where students are required to elaborate on any of these artifacts. In particular, the generation of code affects informatics courses, where assignments usually ask students to develop and deliver programming code. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on informatics courses has been mainly studied for introductory programming courses. These studies have shown that generative artificial intelligence is able to produce highly sophisticated programs, but also that its results and rationale can be inaccurate. Moreover, the impact of generative artificial intelligence has not been studied for other informatics subjects. In this paper, we present our preliminary experience and proposals on three advanced software courses, namely video games, advanced algorithms and language processors. For the video games course, we present the opportunities of use of generative artificial intelligence and the results of a survey conducted with students on their use to obtain different media products. For the algorithms course, we present the result of a session driven by the instructor on different design techniques, showing the merits and demerits of the answers generated.

This polarized perspective neglects the nuanced, pragmatic manifestation of GAI. In general, extreme views oversimplify the technology itself or its potential to address societal issues. The authors suggest a more balanced analysis, acknowledging that GAI’s impacts will unfold dynamically over time as diverse implementations interact with human stakeholders and contextual factors. While Big Tech firms dominate GAI’s supply, its demand is expected to evolve through experimentation and use cases. The authors argue that GAI’s societal impact depends on identifiable contingencies, emphasizing three broad factors: the balance between automation and augmentation, the congruence of physical and digital realities, and the retention of human bounded rationality. These contingencies represent trade-offs arising from GAI instantiations, shaped by technological advancements, stakeholder dynamics, and contextual factors, including societal responses and regulations. Predicting long-term societal effects remains challenging due to unforeseeable discontinuities in the technology’s trajectory.

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI’s capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation’s legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Generative AI; Governance; Sovereignty; Technology","Decision making; Economics; Ethical technology; Public policy; Diverse fields; Generative AI; Governance; Human values; National strategies; Natural languages; Potential benefits; Sovereignty; Technology; ]+ catalyst; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195258694"

Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees' effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study's short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta's 3.08 million formal workers.

Our poster gives an insight into the project’s progress. It presents the innovative low-fidelity prototype based on the “E-Gesetzgebung”, a platform for the electronic legislative process. Our prototype provides legislators with AI-generated context-related text suggestions during the RIA process and offers an initial assessment of the potential impacts and possible mitigation measures. Through this automation of knowledge management, our solution aims to improve the efficiency and quality of the equality-oriented RIA and thus contribute to promoting gender equality in legislation. If developed and integrated into the “E-Gesetzgebung”, we expect our approach to increase RIA executions and create a higher degree of relevance and impact in promoting gender equality in German legislation.

Currently, standards for using GAI in academic medicine remain undefined. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the guidance provided for authors regarding the use of GAI in ophthalmology scientific journals. Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis. Participants: A total of 140 ophthalmology journals listed in the Scimago Journal and Country Rankings, regardless of language or origin. Methods: We systematically searched and screened the 140 ophthalmology journals’ websites on October 19 and 20, 2024, and conducted updates on November 19 and 20, 2024. Main Outcome Measures: The content of GAI guidelines from the websites of the 140 ophthalmology journals. Results: Of 140 journals reviewed, 96 (69%) provide explicit guidelines for authors regarding the use of GAI. Among these, nearly all journals agree on 3 key points: (1) 94 journals (98%) have established specific guidelines prohibiting GAI from being listed as an author; (2) 94 journals (98%) emphasize that human authors are responsible for the outputs generated by GAI tools; and (3) all 96 journals require authors to disclose any use of GAI. In addition, 20 journals (21%) specify that their guidelines pertain solely to the writing process with GAI. Furthermore, 92 journals (66%) have developed guidelines concerning GAI-generated images, with 63 journals (68%) permitting their use and 29 (32%) prohibiting them. Among those that prohibit GAI images, 27 journals (93%) allow their use under specific conditions. Conclusion: Although there is considerable ethical consensus among ophthalmology journals regarding the use of GAI, notable variations exist in terms of permissible use and disclosure practices. Establishing standardized guidelines is essential to safeguard the originality and integrity of scientific research. Researchers must uphold high standards of academic ethics and integrity when using GAI. © 2024 The Author(s)","","article; bibliometrics; consensus; drug therapy; generative artificial intelligence; human; ophthalmology; practice guideline; surgery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214645074"

This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students' use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Central to this study is the concept of 'neural cluster knockout' in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their 'black box' operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance. © 2024 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience Intersection; Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI); Increasing Accuracy and Efficiency in Generative Artificial Intelligence; Large Language Model (LLM); Large Language Model Optimization; Neural Cluster Knockout","Computational linguistics; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Neurons; Principal component analysis; Artificial intelligence and neuroscience intersection; Generative artificial intelligence; Increasing accuracy and efficiency in generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Large language model optimization; Model optimization; Neural cluster knockout; Neural-networks; Efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193248930"

This article examines whether such use constitutes infringement under the American fair use doctrine, drawing insights from the regulatory approaches of the European Union (EU) and Japan. Ultimately, this article advocates for United States courts to recognize the permissibility of using copyrighted materials in training generative AI models, rejecting the EU’s rights-holder-centric approach, and going beyond Japan’s limited-permissibility solution. Through a detailed four-factor fair use analysis, this article demonstrates that training generative AI on copyrighted materials weighs in favor of fair use. The transformative nature of this training fundamentally alters the purpose and character of the copyrighted works, and the societal benefits and technological progress enabled by this training outweighs the potential market impacts on rights holders. Furthermore, in evaluating the EU’s rights-holder-centric regulations and Japan’s “non-enjoyment” provision, which restricts generative AI training based on the intended output of the model, this article proposes that United States courts adopt a modified version of Japan’s non-enjoyment provision in their fair use analysis. This adoption would allow United States courts to accommodate rapid technology development and properly distinguish the permissibility of training generative AI systems from the permissibility of these systems’ output. This article concludes that American copyright law should foster technological growth by finding the use of copyrighted materials in training generative AI systems to be fair use. © 2024 by Serena Chu Lightstone.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213570140"

Generative AI models have a broad impact, and their applications are continuously evolving. Generative AI models are still in their early phases, allowing opportunities for growth in certain areas due to their ongoing development. Generative AI could generate novel content, depending on user input, unlike typical AI models that discover patterns in training data and learn to predict, classify, recommend, or assist in decision-making. Generative AI may learn from existing objects to create realistic, scaled objects that match the training data without repeating it. Generative AI could generate new photos, videos, music, voice, text, software code, and product designs. Prompt paradigm and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) gradually transform GAI from task-specific to generic pattern, allowing it to solve various complex structure–activity correlations.

Generative AI, which tries to make new and useful things, has shown promise in being able to copy creative processes. However, generative AI systems that are already in use often have trouble making results that are truly original. This is mostly because there isn't a clear scientific framework to help people be creative. We present a new mathematical model to improve creativity in creative AI systems in this work. Our model is based on the ideas of lateral and convergent thinking, which are important parts of how people think creatively. Divergent thinking means coming up with many ideas or solutions, while convergent thinking means picking the best ones and making them even better. To put our model into action, we come up with the idea of a ""creativity score,"" which measures how new and useful the results are. The creativity score is determined by looking at a number of things, such as the variety of outputs, how different they are from current solutions, and how useful they are for fixing the problem at hand. Finding the right balance between divergent and convergent thinking is one of the hardest parts of making generative AI systems more creative. Divergent thinking is important for coming up with many ideas, but convergent thinking is needed to pick out the best ones and make them even better. This problem is solved by our model, which uses both divergent and convergent thought. To make sure our model works, we test it on different creative AI tasks, such as making images and writing text. Our results show that our model can greatly improve the creativity of generative AI systems, resulting in more varied, unique, and useful outputs. © 2024, International Publications.

However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports, which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based language models. As expected, most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, for which I discuss potential causes. Together, this study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts. As a proof of concept, I show that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing. © 2023, Verharen.; Peer review is a vital step in ensuring the quality and accuracy of scientific research before publication. Experts assess research manuscripts, advise journal editors on publishing them, and provide authors with recommendations for improvement. But some scientists have raised concerns about potential biases and subjectivity in the peer review process. Author attributes, such as gender, reputation, or how prestigious their institution is, may subconsciously influence reviewers’ scores. Studying peer review to identify potential biases is challenging. The language reviewers use is very technical, and some of their commentary may be subjective and vary from reviewer to reviewer. The emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which uses machine learning to process large amounts of information, may provide a new tool to analyze peer review for signs of bias. Verharen demonstrated that ChatGPT can be used to analyze peer review reports and found potential indications of gender bias in scientific publishing. In the experiments, Verharen asked ChatGPT to analyze more than 500 reviews of 200 neuroscience studies published in the scientific journal Nature Communications over the past year. The experiments found no evidence that institutional reputation influenced reviews. Yet, female first authors were more likely to receive impolite comments from reviewers. Female senior authors were more likely to receive higher review scores, which may indicate they had to clear a higher bar for publication. The experiments indicate that ChatGPT could be used to analyze peer review for fairness. Verharen suggests that reviewers might apply this tool to ensure their reviews are polite and accurate reflections of their opinions. Scientists or publishers might also use it for large-scale analyses of peer review in individual journals or in scientific publishing more widely. Journals might also use ChatGPT to assess the impact of bias-prevention interventions on review fairness.","artificial intelligence; meta-science; natural language processing; neuroscience; none; peer review","Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Male; Peer Review; Publishing; Research Report; Sexism; artificial intelligence; female; human; male; peer review; publishing; research; sexism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176200262"

The aim of this article is to understand consumer reactions to the use of Gen AI. To achieve the research objective, a sample of 36 participants took a test designed to assess their interaction with ChatGPT, using neuroscientific techniques (eye-tracker and facial expression analysis), and a survey. By comparing conscious and unconscious responses (through neuroscientific techniques), the study provides clues as to how GAI influences consumer behaviour. The results show that consumers might still not be entirely happy to integrate GAI into their experience. In fact, the study reveals that the interaction with this technology also arouses negative subconscious emotions of sadness in consumers. Although consumers feel Gen AI is a useful and functional tool for collecting information about products/services, they may not fully accept personalised recommendations from this GAI and still prefer human contact in their shopping experience. This study therefore allows to gain more understanding of how consumers react to the use of GAI, providing certain valuable insights to marketing managers implementing GAI projects and adding theoretical knowledge about consumer relationships with Artificial Intelligence. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","ChatGPT; Consumer behaviour; Consumer reaction; GAI; Generative artificial intelligence; Neuromarketing","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199500925"

This characteristic stems from the long - term training of LLM by experimenters with large corpus of text data reflecting real - world conversation scenes. Its humanoid mental function shows the characteristics of emergence, creation and generalization, and derives a new ethical feature of ‘dishonest anthropomorphism’, which in turn has a negative impact on AIGC social experiments.

However, a gradual shift towards more balanced use of both resources was observed, particularly in formative e-assessments involving statistical analysis and calculation questions. In their interactions with GenAI, students primarily used it for multiple-choice and true/false questions, often by directly copying and pasting the question prompt into the GenAI interface. Students were able to discern and accept accurate responses generated by GenAI and reject those that were incorrect or contradicted their existing knowledge. Students’ reported primary motivations for turning to GenAI were to seek answers to assessment items as well as to corroborate the accuracy of their own responses. This study contributes to the growing body of literature empirically investigating actual usage behaviours with GenAI tools and the motivation behind these behaviours. We discuss the implications and limitations of these findings. Implications for practice or policy: • Educators should develop AI literacy programmes and integrate them into pedagogy strategies. • Educators and researchers need clear guidelines for ethical AI use in formative e-assessments. • Educators should encourage students’ critical thinking and source evaluation on the information that GenAI provides.

This study used a survey methodology (three multiple choice questions and one open-ended question) to explore the perspectives of a nationally representative sample of 1,327 U.S. administrators and faculty, asking questions to understand how much change they anticipate as a result of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, how prepared their institution is for such change, and what aspects of higher education they expect to change. The researchers used Kranzberg’s Laws of Technology as a lens to interpret the findings and guide the subsequent discussion about how AI might impact higher education. The findings showed that the vast majority of participants expect that AI will change their institution over the next five years and that the majority of participants do not feel that their institution is ready for change. The comments left in response to the open-ended questions fell into one of four themes: concerns about academic integrity and rigor, issues related to AI integration (e.g., anticipated benefits, practices in teaching and learning, issues related to preparedness, and the expected scope of change), the feeling that the current AI discourse is merely hype, and feelings of uncertainty. Ultimately, AI has the potential to be both advantageous and disadvantageous to teaching and learning, with the benefits and challenges of its use varying by context. © 2024, The Online Learning Consortium.

The potential impact by GAI on sustainability is multifaceted. On the positive side, generative AI can aid in optimizing processes, developing innovative solutions, and identifying patterns in large datasets related to sustainability. This can lead to more efficient resource management, reduced energy consumption, and the creation of more sustainable products. However, there are also potential negative impacts, such as increased energy consumption associated with training and running generative AI models, as well as the potential for unintended consequences or biases in the generated content. Additionally, overreliance on generative AI may lead to reduced human oversight, which could undermine holistic, interdisciplinary, and collaborative approaches to sustainability. The aim of this paper is to explore the potential impacts on sustainability by generative artificial intelligence through a review of prior research on the topic. The study was conducted with a scoping literature review approach to identify potential impacts by generative AI on sustainability. Data were collected through a search in the database Scopus during the spring semester of 2024. Keywords, relevant for the study, were combined with Boolean operators. Papers identified through the search underwent a manual screening process by the authors, in which papers were selected for inclusion or exclusion in the study based on a set of criteria. Included paper were then analyzed with thematic analysis, according to the guidelines by Braun and Clarke. A categorization matrix, based in prior research on sustainability, supported the analysis and deductive coding of collected data. Results of the study highlight generative AI’s potential impact on sustainability that relate to both environmental aspects, economic aspects, and social aspects of sustainability. These different aspects of sustainability impact make this research an important contribution for deepening the understanding of generative AI and its potential consequences for society. Findings of the study provide theoretical contribution, implications for practice, and recommendations for future research on generative AI and sustainability. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.","Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Generative AI; Social sustainability; Sustainability impact","Sustainable development goals; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Generative artificial intelligence; Image texts; Innovative solutions; Large datasets; Positive sides; Potential impacts; Social sustainability; Sustainability impacts; Generative adversarial networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215661302"

The aim of this article is to examine the ethical implications of GAI in higher education from a three-fold perspective (students, faculty, and institutions). Additionally, it aims to analyze its impact on aspects related to security, accessibility, sustainability and even new forms of plagiarism and academic fraud that involve impersonation of authorship. Based on the literature review conducted, and in accordance with the ideas proposed by some authors, possibilities for integrating GAI into university classrooms will be explored. This will be achieved through pedagogical practices that guide students in the proper use of GAI and enable faculty to seek new educational approaches. This transformation process will require the establishment of clear guidelines that align with ethical codes and integrity policies of higher education institutions.

However, despite clear disclosures stating that these images are not intended for medical consultations, their accuracy and realism are yet to be thoroughly examined. Methods: A series of requests were addressed to the Midjourney AI tool, a renowned generative artificial intelligence application, with a focus on depicting appropriate systemic anatomy and representing aesthetic surgery operations. Subsequently, a blinded panel of four experts, with years of experience in anatomy and aesthetic surgery, assessed the images based on three parameters: accuracy, anatomical correctness, and visual impact. Each parameter was scored on a scale of 1–5. Results: All of images produced by Midjourney exhibited significant inaccuracies and lacked correct anatomical representation. While they displayed high visual impact, their unsuitability for medical training and scientific publications became evident. Conclusions: The implications of these findings are multifaceted. Primarily, the images’ inaccuracies render them ineffective for training, leading to potential misconceptions. Additionally, their lack of anatomical correctness limits their applicability in scientific articles. Although the study focuses on a single AI tool, it underscores the need for collaboration between AI developers and medical professionals. The potential integration of accurate medical databases could refine the precision of such AI tools in the future.

Consequently, we will briefly examine the impact of two key historical innovations: 1) Stone Tools, which marked a technological breakthrough 400,000 years ago and heralded the Stone Age, and 2) the invention of the wheel around 3,500 BCE. The impact of the wheel's invention still resonates today, as countless innovations have been built upon this foundational creation. While some view the wheel as a discovery arising from the observation of natural phenomena, it is clear that the wheel with an axle is indeed a significant human technological innovation. Within the framework of these perspectives and their shared elements, we will endeavor to capture the societal implications of new Technological Innovations centered around Artificial Intelligence. These innovations include Generative Artificial Intelligence (AGI), exemplified by systems like ChatGPT, and Artificial General Intelligence (GAI), as seen in entities like Perplexity AI. We will conclude by suggesting, via analogical thinking, that these novel AI technological advancements follow a similar notional pattern-giving rise to subsequent technological breakthroughs that, in turn, shape cultures. These cultural changes then lead to shifts in moral values, necessitating adaptations in ethics and even the formulation of new laws.

This article has focused on a specific form of artificial intelligence, namely generative intelligence, which facilitates the generation of content in all its forms (text, image, video, audio, programming codes, etc.). Thus, generative artificial intelligence has a crucial role in education, allowing for the personalisation of educational content and facilitating the learning process. In the beginning, the paper has highlighted conceptual delimitations regarding artificial intelligence and its applications in education, along with advantages and limitations, highlighting that the adoption of generative artificial intelligence solutions, such as ChatGPT, in higher education in economics has been relatively underexplored in the literature. In order to cover these gaps identified in the literature, have been presented, in the second part of the paper, the methodology and results of an exploratory research, conducted on a sample of 364 undergraduate and master’s students at the Faculty of Business and Tourism within the Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The research has provided insight into the perception of Business Administration students regarding these applications. The results indicated a high level of awareness and interest in content generation models and highlighted that users with favourable perceptions regarding the quality of content generated by such applications tend to believe that their integration into academic endeavours can foster creativity and enhance employment prospects.

It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students' learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","4E framework; academic evaluation matrix (AVM); academic integrity; education; generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)","Adversarial machine learning; Human resource management; Students; 4e framework; Academic evaluation matrix; Academic integrity; Adoption framework; Adoption process; Artificial intelligence in education; Evaluation matrices; Generative artificial intelligence; IT Identify; University curricula; Generative adversarial networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206650552"

Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.","Artificial intelligence; Large Language Models; Natural language processing; Personalized hemodialysis","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Software; algorithm; artificial intelligence; hemodialysis; human; quality of life; software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181395946"

The three robots adopted in the study were Microsoft Copilot, Google PaLM, and Meta Llama, which were individually instructed to accord rating scores to the eight major usability dimensions, namely, (1) content/course quality, (2) pedagogical design, (3) learner support, (4) technology infrastructure, (5) social interaction, (6) learner engagement, (7) instructor support, and (8) cost-effectiveness of 17 currently most popular mobile learning apps. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the eight dimensions were computed across all the mobile learning apps. The rating score difference for each of the eight dimensions between any pair of the above three robots was calculated for each app. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all the apps. A paired sample t-test was then applied to each dimension for the rating score difference between each robot pair over all the apps. Finally, Cronbach’s coefficient alpha of the rating scores was computed for each of the eight dimensions between all the three robots across all the apps. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots awarded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the apps, whether each robot, with respect to any other robot, erratically and/or systematically overrate or underrate any dimension over the apps, and whether there was high convergent validity of (and thus consistency between) the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the apps.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, collaboration between designers and AIGC tools is becoming increasingly popular, which has triggered a profound reflection on the creative process and results. This study adopts in-depth interviews and literature analysis methods to analyze the impact of AIGC driven graphic design tools on the creative thinking of designers. Firstly, research has found that AIGC tools can quickly generate a large number of creative concepts and design drafts, providing designers with more sources of inspiration. The use of this tool can stimulate the creative thinking of designers, making it easier for them to try different design styles and element combinations. However, at the same time, some designers have also raised concerns that AIGC may weaken their creative output, as excessive reliance on these tools may lead to a decrease in designer creativity. Secondly, this study emphasizes the role of AIGC tools in the design process. They can not only be used for creative inspiration, but also for automated repetitive tasks, allowing designers to focus more on creative and strategic work. This division of labor and collaboration approach provides designers with more time to think, explore, and advance design projects, which helps to improve the quality of creative thinking. In summary, AIGC driven graphic design tools have played an important role in stimulating creative thinking among designers, but there are also some challenges. Designers need to recognize the advantages and limitations of AIGC tools and integrate them into their creative process to achieve more innovative and in-depth design works. This study provides a deep understanding of the application of AIGC in the field of graphic design and valuable insights for future research and practice. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","AIGC generation tool; Creative thinking; Designers; Graphic design; Influencing factors","Design; AIGC generation tool; Artificial intelligence technologies; Creative process; Creative thinking; Creatives; Design tool; Designer; Generation tools; Graphic design; Influencing factor; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196175638"

AI has the potential to personalize education and create more engaging learning experiences. However, the effectiveness of AI interventions relies on well-considered implementation strategies. The impact of AI platforms in education is largely determined by the particular learning environment and the distinct needs of each student. Consequently, investigating the attitudes of future educators towards this technology is becoming a critical area of research. This study explores the impact of generative AI platforms on students’ learning performance, experience, and satisfaction within higher education. It specifically focuses on students’ experiences with varying levels of technological proficiency. A comparative study was conducted with two groups from different academic contexts undergoing the same experimental condition to design, develop, and implement instructional design projects using various AI platforms to produce multimedia content tailored to their respective subjects. Undergraduates from two disciplines—Early Childhood Education (n = 32) and Computer Science (n = 34)—participated in this study, which examined the integration of generative AI platforms into educational content implementation. Results indicate that both groups demonstrated similar learning performance in designing, developing, and implementing instructional design projects. Regarding user experience, the general outcomes were similar across both groups; however, Early Childhood Education students rated the usefulness of AI multimedia platforms significantly higher. Conversely, Computer Science students reported a slightly higher comfort level with these tools. In terms of overall satisfaction, Early Childhood Education students expressed greater satisfaction with AI software than their counterparts, acknowledging its importance for their future careers. This study contributes to the understanding of how AI platforms affect students from diverse backgrounds, bridging a gap in the knowledge of user experience and learning outcomes. Furthermore, by exploring best practices for integrating AI into educational contexts, it provides valuable insights for educators and scholars seeking to optimize the potential of AI to enhance educational outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; computer science; digital literacy; early childhood education; higher education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205225069"

This article examines the general function of GAI in education and how it alters the nature of learning experiences. This paper explores the use of GAI in personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and accessible education through a thorough literature review and analysis. Personalized learning experiences are made possible by GAI’s capacity to analyze sizable amounts of data about specific students. GAI may modify educational content and instructional procedures to suit each student’s needs by taking into account each one’s individual learning preferences, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and progress. This personalized method encourages involvement, greater comprehension, and higher learning results. The crucial function that GAI plays in education also includes intelligent tutoring. GAI offers pupils specialized training, criticism, and direction as a virtual tutor. Depending on the student’s needs, it can provide answers, clarify complex topics, and give more resources. The most effective and efficient educational support is offered to pupils thanks to GAI’s adaptive teaching methods and real-time changes. GAI also has the potential to deal with the problem of accessible education. GAI-powered online platforms can offer access to top-notch education in outlying regions or underserved communities. The accessibility and scalability of GAI enable the distribution of instructional content to people without physical access to conventional educational institutions. This inclusiveness encourages equitable learning opportunities and lessens educational inequities. Although the potential for the abstract use of GAI in education is enormous, there are still issues that need to be resolved, including those related to ethics, privacy, and the requirement for human oversight. This article adds to the continuing conversation about the use of GAI in education and emphasizes how it has a transformative effect on improving learning opportunities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Accessible education; Education; Generative artificial intelligence (GAI); Intelligent tutoring; Personalized learning; Transformative impact","Abstracting; Computer aided instruction; Students; Accessible education; Artificial intelligence in education; Enhanced learning; General functions; Generative artificial intelligence; Intelligent tutoring; Learning experiences; Learning opportunity; Personalized learning; Transformative impact; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200728509"

Educators should embrace the technological affordances of AI to improve their teaching. However, it is first incumbent upon teacher educators to develop training programs that familiarize teachers with AI tools and their applications in educational settings. The aim of this study was to design a 45-min training session for pre-service teachers to use the AI chatbot Microsoft Copilot and identify ways AI can be used to assist with future teaching practices, particularly the creation of learning materials. The design of the intervention focused on demonstrating the usefulness and ease of use of the AI chatbot. Data from 43 pre-service teachers was collected and AI-assisted qualitative analysis performed. The results show that teachers perceive the AI tool to be most beneficial in the following categories: lesson planning, creating assessment questions and tasks, creating images, brainstorming and idea generation, creating educational games, generating text and rewriting text. This study provides initial insights on how AI tools like Microsoft Copilot can be introduced to teachers and how teacher education programs can help develop AI literacy among educators. More research is necessary to explore the long-term impacts of such training on teaching practices and student outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","AI Literacy; AI-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Teacher Education; Technology Integration","Application programs; Personnel training; Teaching; Artificial intelligence literacy; Artificial intelligence tools; Artificial intelligence-assisted qualitative data analyse; Generative artificial intelligence; MicroSoft; Preservice teachers; Qualitative data; Teacher education; Teachers'; Technology Integration; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200516622"

Literature suggests that educators and researchers have many varied concerns regarding student assessment in the higher education GenAI context, such as how to assess students’ learning and the new (refocused) learning outcomes that emerged in GenAI-facilitated learning environments. To provide evidence-based insights into and answers to these concerns, we conducted a scoping review by collating literature in relevant research areas. Following a five-stage scoping review framework, we collaboratively collected and coded 34 studies. The three assessment approaches identified in the review were traditional assessment, innovative and refocused assessment and GenAI-incorporated assessment. The new, refocused learning outcomes identified were career-driven competencies and lifelong learning skills. The review also revealed that most research designs were qualitatively oriented (e.g., with exploratory design, descriptive research, ethnographic research and phenomenological research). This study proposes a holistic diagram showing the current research status and trends. It suggests five future research directions: innovative assessment designs, collaborations among assessment approaches, new learning outcomes, relationships between assessment approaches and learning outcomes, and quantitative or mixed research studies. Implications for practice or policy: • Traditional assessment methods in higher education do not operate effectively in the GenAI era. • Innovative and refocused assessment and GenAI-incorporated assessment are promising strategies to assess student learning. • Career-driven competencies and lifelong learning skills are new focused learning outcomes evolved from the use of GenAI. • More quantitative and mixed research studies should be conducted to provide additional empirical evidence on the impact of GenAI on student assessment and learning outcomes. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

This pre-study examines how students make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for their academic writing processes, transitioning from solitary writing to true human-machine collaboration. Participants were recruited from a workshop on LLMs and were subsequently interviewed qualitatively after two weeks of unsupervised usage. These interviews were designed using the new Overall Writing Effectiveness (OWE) framework and focused on LLMs’ role in academic writing. The qualitative content of these interviews was analysed following Mayring’s methodology. Findings indicate that LLMs did not substantially accelerate the writing process but enhanced the quality of the texts and redefined writing as a collaborative effort. This study not only explores the limits of automation in academic writing but also highlights how generative AI is pushing the boundaries of what is considered genuine human capabilities.

A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept 'Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term ""Generative AI"". While the broader public often interprets ""Generative AI"" as AI-driven creation of tangible content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without explicitly categorizing their work under the term ""Generative AI"". © 2023, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

While the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial intelligence products, which present unique challenges and opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework. Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention. In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building measures.

Through a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both qualitative insights from ChatGPT 4.0-generated 'Personas' representing international experts and quantitative analysis, this study evaluates the potential risks and delineates strategic pathways for the responsible implementation of Gen AI under limited financial and technological resources. The 'Personas' provided evaluations on a Likert scale, assessing risks, required actions, and resources necessary for Gen AI integration, which were then analyzed through descriptive statistics and visualized for interpretation. The findings highlight the most significant challenges as legal and ethical issues, technological dependence, and student development, echoing concerns noted in existing literature. To mitigate these risks, the study suggests a series of sequential strategies including promoting balanced technology use, investing in mental health initiatives, developing skills for educators, supporting AI literacy, creating culturally responsive AI content, and developing inclusive technology policies. Moreover, creating AI tools to enhance teaching and investing in equitable technological infrastructure are identified as resource-intensive actions, with a special emphasis on the prioritization of human resource investment as a starting point for HEIs with financial constraints. It is crucial to note the limitations of this work, given that the expert 'Personas' are bound by the training data and capabilities of the Large Language Model used. Therefore, the careful evaluation of the advice provided to ensure alignment with each institution's mission and philosophy is mandatory. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights and a call-to-action for HEIs to lead the charge in integrating Gen AI across society. © 2024 IEEE.","Academic Integrity; AI Ethics; Educational Equity; Educational Innovation; Higher Education; Technological Literacy; Workforce Disruption","Education computing; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Health risks; Investments; Risk assessment; Academic integrity; AI ethic; Educational equity; Educational innovations; High educations; Higher education institutions; Learning assessment; Teaching-learning; Technological literacy; Workforce disruption; Developing countries","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201198083"

Research on LLMs was in the exploratory phase, characterized by discussions and observations rather than empirical investigations. This study presented a framework for incorporating LLMs into Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), utilizing a case study on submarine construction, followed by a four-week quasi-experimental validation. The research employed conditional cluster sampling, selecting two homogeneous natural classes from a middle school in China to serve as the experimental and control groups. The key experimental variable was the inclusion of LLMs in the SEP project. Various validated and self-developed assessment tools were used to measure students’ STEM learning outcomes. Statistical analyses, including pre- and post-test paired comparisons within classes and ANCOVA for between-class differences, were performed to evaluate the effects of LLM integration. The results showed that students participating in SEP integrated with LLMs significantly improved their mastery of scientific knowledge, attitudes towards science, perceived usefulness of technology, understanding of engineering, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, students participating in traditional SEP exhibited weaker knowledge acquisition, differences in understanding engineering concepts, and lack of development in computational thinking and problem-solving skills. This study was a pioneering effort in integrating LLMs into science education and provided a framework and case reference for the deeper application of LLMs in the future. © The Author(s) 2025.","artificial intelligence in instruction; large language model; science and engineering practice; science education","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214385996"

Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.  © 2024 IEEE.","Chatbot tool; ChatGPT; Generative AI; High Education; Machine learning","Learning systems; Machine learning; Chatbot tool; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Educational environment; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Immersive technologies; Machine-learning; Student perspectives; Support tool; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199030882"

How ought courses be redesigned for fair and resilient assessment? What the added pedagogical and didactical values when involving GenAI in teaching and learning activities? Different universities have rapidly created and presented contradictory standpoints and draft policies, and teachers show different opinions regarding the pros and cons of GenAI. This study has been carried out with a student perspective, where 16 students have been examining their own Master's programme on sustainable information provision. Students have assessed the assessment in their previous courses in the Master's programme. The aim of the study is to investigate how sustainable course activities and assignment are, and to explore how GenAI tools might support and facilitate teaching and learning activities. Moreover, the students were given the task to test detection software on GenAI generated solutions to assignments in chosen Master's courses. Students conducted these tasks as a part of a 7.5 ECTS project course in the same Master's programme as the investigated courses are a part of. For inspiration and for background information on artificial intelligence to the project work students participated in the first Symposium on AI Opportunities and Challenges (SAIOC) in December 2023. Data have been gathered from reports of 3 group projects where 16 students have investigated 5 freely chosen courses in the programme in each group work. Beside from testing GenAI tools in existing activities and assignments students also interviewed the subject matter experts that are responsible for the chosen courses. Results were firstly analysed and presented in group reports, combined with 16 individual reflection essays. Regarding the individual essays students were instructed to bring up ethical perspectives on GenAI in higher education, and also to present and discuss suggestions for how the current course design and assignments better could be redesigned for improved sustainability and fairness. Finally, all the group reports and the individual reflection essays were thematically analysed by the author, who also is the subject matter expert and main teacher for the project course. Findings show that many of the existing assignments in the Master's programme could be partly solved with different GenAI tools. The AI generated solutions showed different levels of quality and correctness for different types of activities and assignments. An ethical concern that many student essays brought up was the relatively poor quality of the tested detection software. A question in one of the essays was if teachers should use detection software with an accuracy rate just above 50% to evaluate student submissions. The recommendations from both the students and the author are to provide clear instructions about when GenAI is allowed and not in course activities, and to redesign the course structure for continuous assessment. With or without GenAI tools, a continuous assessment where the whole study path through a course is assessed, and not only isolated submissions, would strengthen fairness and sustainability. Finally, several students suggest oral examinations as a complement to the existing assessment methods, even if their findings showed that GenAI tools can be used to prepare oral presentations. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.","Artificial intelligence; GenAI; Generative AI; Higher education; Sustainable education","Curricula; Teaching; Detection software; Generative AI; High educations; Learning Activity; Master programs; Sustainable educations; Teachers'; Teaching activities; Teaching and learning; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215708071"

Eighty-five percent of our medical schools’ faculty responded to had heard about GenAI, while 42% had not used it at all. Generating text (33%), automating repetitive tasks (19%), and creating multimedia content (17%) were some of the common utilizations of GenAI by school faculty. The majority agreed that GenAI is likely to change its role as an educator. A perceived advantage of GenAI in conducting more effective background research was reported by 54% of faculty. The greatest perceived strengths of GenAI were the ability to conduct more efficient research, task automation, and increased content accessibility. The faculty’s major concerns were cheating in home assignments in assessment (97%), tendency for blunder and false information (95%), lack of context (86%), and removal of human interaction in important feedback processes (83%). The majority of the faculty agrees on the lack of guidelines for safe use of GenAI from both a governmental and an institutional policy. The main perceived challenges were cheating, the tendency of GenAI to make errors, and privacy concerns. The faculty recognized the potential impact of GenAI in medical education. Careful deliberation of the pros and cons of GenAI is needed for its effective integration into medical education. There is general agreement that plagiarism and lack of regulations are two major areas of concern. Consensus-based guidelines at the institutional and/or national level need to start to be implemented to govern the appropriate use of GenAI while maintaining ethics and transparency. Faculty responses reflect an optimistic and favorable outlook on GenAI’s impact on student learning. © 2024 American Federation for Medical Research.","Generative artificial intelligence; GPT; medical education","Artificial Intelligence; Education, Medical; Faculty, Medical; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Article; attitude; curriculum; generative artificial intelligence; health care personnel; human; medical education; medical educator; medical student; organizational policy; training; artificial intelligence; female; male; medical school; perception; questionnaire","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206082166"

Chatbots were the most popular among the surveyed teachers, with ChatGPT ranking as the most familiar. The teachers were almost equally split between those who reported use and those who declared nonuse of AI technology for instructional purposes. A significant association was found between the teachers’ familiarity with and use of AI technology and their age-related generational traits. The younger educators (up to 40 years of age) were associated with higher use of AI technology as a support tool for creating lesson plans, lesson content, tests, and exams. The outlined tendencies can be used to inform policy, professional development, and future research in the realm of AI-driven education. © 2024, Institute for Bulgarian Language.

However, due to differences in knowledge about the themes among participants, establishing a common understanding takes time, and there is a limited timeframe for considering and consolidating ideas. As a result, facilitators play a crucial role in guiding the discussions among residents, but there is a shortage of facilitators relative to the opportunities for discussions. Consequently, it is challenging for participants alone to consolidate high-quality ideas. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are anticipated to be valuable in supporting idea generation. On the other hand, there is a risk of developing ideas overly dependent on generative AI if used improperly. Therefore, it is crucial to first understand the effect that generative AI can have on group discussions. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine effective usages of ChatGPT during small group ideation discussions.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can create content such as text, tables, and images can be used for many tasks in academic writing such as summarizing, translating, paraphrasing, data analysis, and presentation. Therefore, AI is expected to be widely used in academic writing in the near future and have a significant impact. Understanding this impact is far from trivial and needs to be carefully studied. The first step in doing so is to be able to identify papers written with the help of AI tools. This can be done by adding metadata on the use of AI in academic results.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation models (MM), this study analyzes the pathways of interaction and mediation effects among these variables. The research identifies that CT and LA positively influence the use of AIGC, which in turn fosters the development of IEA and ALA. Additionally, IEA acts as a mediator between the use of AIGC and ALA. The study also discusses potential issues associated with the application of AIGC in education, including academic integrity concerns and the potential decline in students’ higher-order cognitive skills. The findings underscore the importance of judiciously integrating AIGC and cultivating students’ innovation and autonomous learning capabilities in education.

This mini-review methodically describes GAI’s practical implementations and limitations in meeting these needs. It included journal and conference papers from 2019 to 2024, focusing on empirical studies that employ GAI tools in educational contexts while addressing their practical utility and ethical considerations. The selection criteria excluded non-English studies, non-empirical research, and works published before 2019. From the dataset obtained from Scopus and Web of Science as of June 18, 2024, four significant studies were reviewed. These studies involved tools like ChatGPT and emphasized their effectiveness in boosting student engagement and emotional regulation through interactive learning environments with instant feedback. Nonetheless, the review reveals substantial deficiencies in GAI’s capacity to promote critical thinking and maintain response accuracy, potentially leading to learner confusion. Moreover, the ability of these tools to tailor learning experiences and offer emotional support remains limited, often not satisfying individual learner requirements. The findings from the included studies suggest limited generalizability beyond specific GAI versions, with studies being cross-sectional and involving small participant pools. Practical implications underscore the need to develop teaching strategies leveraging GAI to enhance critical thinking. There is also a need to improve the accuracy of GAI tools’ responses. Lastly, deep analysis of intervention approval is needed in cases where GAI does not meet acceptable error margins to mitigate potential negative impacts on learning experiences.

In doing so, it echoes a central thought from Neil Postman's provocatively named book which reflects on the nature and purposes of education. Whilst GenAI may be approached with a constructivist disposition, much of the response in practice and policy is marked by technological determinism. A constructivist approach, however, allows us to (re)consider the nature and value of education. The paper therefore maintains the angle of the educator in asking: what are we trying to do in (higher) education? What is the purpose of Higher Education today? This is a cross-disciplinary question, much like Postman’s propositions were a cross-curricular reflection on the nature of schooling. Postman looked for a unifying narrative that can inspire ‘the ends of education’, or what education actually is and tries to accomplish, before considering its tools and approaches towards those goals. Those ends ensure that education does not become subjected to the false gods, such as economic utility and consumerism. These would spell the demise of any meaningful education, or ‘the end of education’. What appears foundational to these questions is a belief in the nature of human potential. In education, the cultivation of that potential is arguably a fundamental end, whichever way education is organised. Where the cultivation of that potential leads, however, can remain rooted in a humanist framework, it could become posthumanist, or it could be simply bewildering. With the means of generative AI, the analysis raises questions on epistemic threat versus intellectual success, and new horizons of creative possibility in human-computer interaction. The human potentiality of thinking, interpreting, criticality, and scepticism, come forward as retained elements of the humanist narrative. In the dawn of generative AI as a teaching, learning, and assessment instrument, the end of education remains human potential. Higher Education especially, remains the place to critically and ethically stimulate the human mind towards new horizons of knowing. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.","GenAI; HE; Postman; Purpose of education; Technological determinism","Contrastive Learning; Generative adversarial networks; Constructivist approaches; Creatives; Cross-disciplinary; GenAI; HE; High educations; Human potential; Postman; Purpose of education; Technological determinism","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215665907"

Still only a few studies have analyzed and evaluated specific solutions for different areas of marketing, including advert design. In order to fill this gap, areas where GAI and ChatGPT are used during the various stages of creating a digital advertising campaign have been identified. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of GAI and ChatGPT on theory and practice on different stages of the digital advertising campaign building process. This objective is followed by a research question: how can marketers use GAI and ChatGPT to create an effective digital advertising campaign? The process of building a digital advertising campaign should be considered and analyzed in terms of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT technology and, at the same time, the role played by marketers at each stage and their contribution to this process in collaboration with GAI-based tools. This article is intended as a preliminary exploration of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT on the digital marketing campaign building process. Therefore, the methodology applied includes critical literature analysis, secondary data analysis and individual in depth interview (IDI) with an expert (CEO of a advertising agency). This represents a first step in the study, to be followed by in-depth empirical research (qualitative as well as quantitative) to verify and develop the conclusions drawn.

It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from a vast amount of data to generate similar or even innovative content. This type of AI is used in several fields, such as health for the production of new drugs, design to generate adaptive designs, video games to create immersive environments, and artificial intelligence to generate training data for new networks. Seizing the opportunities offered by AI innovations in education is crucial. We cannot afford to let time pass without doing anything and without benefiting from this technique. It is time to enhance traditional learning methods and adopt more innovative approaches that take advantage of the potential of AI, like content and exam generation, and also improve students' learning experience by exploiting their closeness to the technology. This paper aims to answer the question of when and how to use artificial intelligence responsibly, considering it as a technology and limiting its excessive use. Additionally, we present the impact of GAI through a comparative study of student performance in three exam types: a classical MCQ exam written by the teacher, an adaptive MCQ exam generated by GAI from a topic, and a third MCQ exam generated by GAI based on the content of the provided documents. This study is conducted on students undergoing a software testing training program. By evaluating their performance in the AI-generated adaptive MCQ exams and the traditional MCQ exam, we can gain insights into the potential of this technology to enhance educational practices and provide personalized learning experiences. This research will contribute to the ongoing discussion on responsible and effective utilization of GAI in education, paving the way for future advancements in the field. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

Although generative AI technology has been around for over a decade, one could even trace relevant research back to the 1960s [2], it was the release of ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI, that brought this innovative technology into the limelight and allowed general population to access it, disrupting not only the technology sector (e.g., IT), but more recently, the academic world in terms of content generation from both the students and faculty perspectives. This WIP paper will not dive deep into the technicality of generative AI technology- that is out of the scope of this study; but instead, it will focus on the experimental application of ChatGPT in the academic setting, to be more specific, its aid in instructional and course design. The METM program curriculum offers courses that focus on Project Management, Strategic Planning and Management, Financial Resource Management, etc., that are included in the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK)[3]. At the conclusion of the METM program, students must research, design, and showcase a real-world project that requires comprehensive application of the knowledge they have learned throughout the program, in order to bring significant impact to the stakeholders of their chosen organizations. The Capstone course spans over two semesters, Fall (Capstone I) and Spring (Capstone II); it was first offered in 2019, and in 2023, the fifth student cohort started their Capstone project. The program has been continuously evaluating and improving its courses based on stakeholder feedback, industry demands, while upholding its academic rigor. Until today, Capstone has been through three iterations of revamps: Capstone 1.0 restructured the original, Capstone 2.0 rebalanced industry-academic focus [4], and Capstone 3.0 was an instructional redesign of learning modules, which were all done through human input (subject matter expert and learners). As the course matures, fine tuning the assessments (project deliverables) has become the focus of improvement. This WIP paper will use a case study approach to find insights in using ChatGPT to design the Capstone course. Starting from the creating the grading rubrics for one course deliverable, Project Charter, given grounding parameters to the prompt (course level, learner characteristics, generic grading categories, etc.); then, dissecting the thought process of each sub criterion to develop details of the rubric; then, asking ChatGPT to create study plan (topics, resources, activities) to achieve the high marks of the grading criteria; note that for each step, human input from Capstone faculty and instructional designer will be fed into ChatGPT to refine the prompts until a better result is generated before proceeding to the next step. Then, repeat the process for other course deliverables. This study will keep the log of the process (prompts, refinements) mentioned above and take notes of the pros and cons of ChatGPT's application in the course design tasks, and discuss the limitations of this approach. The result of this study will potentially lay a clearer path for other courses that would like to give this innovative technology a try for course development/improvement. For future study, we would also like to apply similar techniques to the development of new courses within the METM program. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Capstone project; Engineering Research; Generative AI; Instructional Design","Behavioral research; Cost effectiveness; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Enterprise resource management; Generative adversarial networks; High-entropy alloys; Resource allocation; Strategic planning; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence technologies; Capstone course; Capstone projects; Course design; Generative artificial intelligence; Graduate-level; Innovative technology; Instructional designs; Management projects; Technical management; Project management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202015053"

Despite its promise, debates persist regarding GenAI impacts, with critical voices highlighting the necessity for thorough ethical scrutiny. While traditional ethical evaluations of GenAI tend to focus on the opacity of AI decision-making, we argue that the true challenge for ethical evaluation extends beyond the models themselves, and to the socio-technical networks shaping GenAI development and training. To address this limitation, we present an evaluation method, called Ethical Network Evaluation for AI (ENEA), which combines Latour’s Actor-Network Theory—used to map network dynamics by tracing actors’ interests and values—with Brusseau’s AI Human Impact framework, which identifies ethical indicators for evaluating AI systems. By applying ENEA to GenAI “copilots” in education, we show how making Actor-Networks visible lets us unveil a great variety of dilemmas, guiding ethical auditing and stakeholder discussions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Actor-Network Theory; AI for Education; AI human impact; GitHub Copilot; Programming classes; socio-technical systems","Ethical technology; Social sciences computing; Actor-network; Actor-network theory; AI for education; AI human impact; Github copilot; Human impact; Network evaluation; Programming class; Sociotechnical systems; Teaching and learning; Decision making","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200244342"

We examine how GenAI impact the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and application, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges this technology presents. In knowledge creation, GenAI enhances information? processing and cognitive functions, fostering individual and organizational learning. However, it also introduces risks like AI bias and reduced human socialization, potentially marginalizing junior knowledge workers. For knowledge storage and retrieval, GenAI’s ability to quickly access vast knowledge bases significantly changes employee interactions with KM systems. This raises questions about balancing human-derived tacit knowledge with AI-generated explicit knowledge. The paper also explores GenAI’s role in knowledge transfer, particularly in training and cultivating a learning culture. Challenges include an over-reliance on AI and risks in disseminating sensitive information. In terms of knowledge application, GenAI is seen as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, but issues like knowledge misapplication, intellectual property, and ethical considerations are critical. Conclusively, the paper argues for a balanced approach to integrating GenAI into KM processes. It advocates for harmonizing GenAI’s capabilities with human insights to effectively manage knowledge in contemporary organizations, ensuring both technological advances and ethical responsibility. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.","AI-Driven Innovation; Ethical Implications of AI; GenAI Integration in Organizations; Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI); Knowledge Management; Knowledge Workers; Organizational Learning","","Editorial","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182193435"

The sweeping changes brought by GenAI in the educational arena have implications for adult learning. GenAI in education will usher in a world of adult learning that will be radically different from its predecessor. However, how adult learners will apply GenAI technologies to achieve their educational and professional goals remains blurred. To address this gap, it is crucial to examine essential principles for integrating GenAI into adult learning. For effective digital transformation of education, GenAI should optimize adult learning and ensure the safety of adult learners. This study proposes a “GenAI adult learning ecology” framework (GenAI-ALE) for higher education institutions in this digital era permeated by GenAI. The GenAI-ALE considers eight (8) essential principles categorized into two main themes; institutional factors (GenAI curriculum design, GenAI divide, GenAI policy, GenAI ethics) and interpersonal factors (GenAI human-centered andragogy, GenAI literacy, GenAI interest, and GenAI virtual learning). Malcolm Knowles’ andragogical model is used to provide a context for integrating GenAI into adult learning. Applying the framework in a real-world context follows four iterative systematic steps; pre-perception and perception, GenAI readiness, assessment, and outcome. Reimagining new forms of adult learning in the GenAI revolution calls for higher education institutions to develop education systems where there is a synergy between humans (adult learners) and GenAI. © 2024 The Author(s).","adult learning; artificial intelligence; GenAI; generative AI; higher education","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200234656"

The working paper aims to capture various aspects of AI and its impact on labor structure, obstacles in its path to full maturity, and pathways for new possibilities. Drawing into neoclassical economics, labour studies, and digital technology literature, this article surveys the state of knowledge on how AI fits within work and employment in an all-encompassing analysis of the relationship between these two fields.The coming of artificial intelligence brings danger and promise in restructuring the future of work. AI development promises substantial disruption in traditional employment patterns and occupational distribution. AI threatens to increase economic inequality and social dislocation, where the traditional careers disappear because human labor is more than thoroughly displaced in almost all sectors and industries. However, that is between the shadows of challenge and promise. Appropriately guided AI can create new types of work suited to the new skill requirements. Shining a light on these dynamics helps policymakers design interventions that can counter the adverse impacts on more vulnerable populations. Locking AI is a strategy unto itself; just as a deep analysis into the root cause and impact of labor market disruption can open the way to maximizing benefit from technology while reducing harm. Proper management of the changes to society brought by AI will allow humans to create a future in which prosperity can be more equitably distributed.This brings out the necessity of proactive measures to be taken through policies aimed at creating a conducive environment for fair integration of AI technologies at work. Some of the education and reskilling programs, as well as labor market regulations, and strategies on inclusive economic growth are of importance. A culture that promotes lifelong learning and adaptability with an evolving economy driven by an AI-concept is also of concern. © 2024 IEEE.","artificial Intelligence (AI); automation; digital economy; economic impact; future of work; human-AI collaboration; job displacement; technological adaptation; workforce development","Inflation; Artificial intelligence; Digital economy; Economic impacts; Forcings; Future of works; Human-artificial intelligence collaboration; Job displacement; Labour market; Technological adaptation; Workforce development; Commerce","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215292819"

Recent studies into the integration of GenAI tools in academia have focused on opportunities for education and challenges to consider. In this context, few frameworks and models have been proposed, but none have addressed the need for a comprehensive and practical framework to facilitate teachers’ efforts to integrate GenAI into their classrooms. This study, therefore, addresses this research gap by developing a framework for the integration of GenAI in classrooms, the LAIK framework. The framework is designed to identify the necessary elements that should be considered before, during, and after integrating GenAI tools in higher education classrooms. To build the framework, data were collected from teachers, students, and classroom observations. Results from the study highlighted the need for four practical stages in this framework, namely (1) laying the foundation, (2) assembling GenAI-friendly classes, (3) investigating and monitoring, and (4) keeping the teacher informed. The framework also offers a variety of options to consider for practical ways to integrate GenAI technology to support learning in the classroom. © 2024. Sebah Al-Ali, Ahmed Tlili and A. R.

The Industrial Revolution 2.0 was propelled by electricity- and oil-based power in nineteenth century for mass production. The Industrial Revolution 3.0 was cultivated in the twentieth century through Electronics and Information and Communication Technologies for automatic production. The current phase of Industrial Revolution 4.0 in twenty-first century is built over the Industrial Revolution 3.0; but indeed is distinct from it due to its exponential growth, scope and impact across different sectors and industries in the Anthropocene age or era of humans. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is led by technologies with ‘Digital Intelligence’ such as ‘Internet of things’, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, ‘Cloud Computing’, ‘Quantum Computing’, etc. Within the artificial intelligence (AI), the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) with its scale, scope, and complexity will progress toward a period that humankind has never experienced before. Parallel to the development of the digitally intelligent machines have emerged a new set of generational human rights which can also be called as ‘Digital Rights’ to safeguard our human rights in digital space. Right to be forgotten (RTBF) is one such emerging legal and digital right in civil, criminal, and tortious justice system.

While some teachers expressed frustration over pupil misuse of generative AI, others advocated for the availability of a schoolrelevant chatbot for pupil use. In October 2023, a local chatbot intended to meet that goal was launched by Oslo Municipality. After six weeks, an investigation was conducted to examine how 236 teachers perceived the opportunities and limitations of this new technology. The examination used structural equation modelling to explore antecedents of instructional AI utility. The analysis shows that the pathway between instructional self-efficacy and AI utility has the highest positively charged value, while the pathways between management and AI utility have low numerical value. This last finding can be interpreted as the influence of an untapped management potential and must be seen in context of the fact that no guidelines for the use of AI in schools existed when the survey was conducted. In addition, the pathway between colleague discussion and AI utility has relatively low numerical values. The potential for learning through discussion among colleagues can be utilized to an even greater degree. The pathway between management and colleague discussion is remarkable.

However, few studies to date have explored student perspectives on these tools. This article reports on one of the first large-scale quantitative studies of student views on generative artificial intelligence at an Australian university (n = 1,135). When the survey was conducted, most students had low knowledge, experience, and confidence in using these tools. These results varied across disciplines and across some student sub-groups, such as mature-age students and international students. Confidence appeared to increase with experience, although the data also revealed a portion of students that have never used these tools yet still felt confident in using them. In exploring these results, this article aims to shed new light on this fast-evolving landscape and inform the future direction of supporting students to engage with generative artificial intelligence tools appropriately. Practitioner Notes 1. Students need to be explicitly taught how to use generative artificial intelligence tools appropriately. 2. Learning activities that build student skills in using generative artificial intelligence should be embedded into curricula. 3. The ways in which students learn how to use generative artificial intelligence will need to vary based on the needs of each disciplinary area. 4. Student reports of self-confidence in using generative artificial intelligence may be overstated. 5.

A mixed exploratory research approach was employed to understand these impacts, combining analysis of current research trends and students’ perceptions of the effects of Gen AI tools in academia. Through bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review, 64 publications (indexed in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases) were examined, highlighting Gen AI’s disruptive effect on the pedagogical aspects of HE. The impacts identified by the literature were compared with the perceptions held by computer science students of two different HE institutions (HEIs) on the topic. An exploratory study was developed based on the application of a questionnaire to a group of 112 students. The results suggest that while Gen AI can enhance academic work and learning feedback, it requires appropriate pedagogical support to foster critical, ethical, and digital literacy competencies. Students demonstrate awareness of both the risks and benefits associated with Gen AI in academic settings. The research concludes that failing to recognize and effectively use Gen AI in HE impedes educational progress and the adequate preparation of citizens and workers to think and act in an AI-mediated world. © 2024 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; generative artificial intelligence; higher education; impacts; students’ perceptions; systematic literature review","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202459256"

As a result, educators’ concerns in the higher education sector quickly emerged. Many organizations and experts have addressed these concerns through recommendations. In this conceptual paper, we draw from the Integrated Model for Academic Integrity through a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Lens to examine and stimulate discussion from twelve documents that focus on using GenAI with integrity. We identified recommendations suitable for the individual (micro), the departmental/program (meso), the institutional (macro), and the interinstitutional/ national/ international (mega) levels concerning two core elements of the model: “high-impact professional learning for individuals and groups” and “local-level leadership and microcultures.” Suggestions around the core element “scholarship, research and inquiry” were lacking at the micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element “learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies” were also absent at the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on GenAI. © (2023), (Universidad de Granada).

However, the development and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT system presents an opportunity to address these issues. Some CIDI model-based ChatGPT systems have been developed, but how to effectively apply these technologies in nursing education design courses remains a challenging problem for researchers. In order to explore the application mode and effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT technology in nursing education, this study integrated generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT system into the teaching activities of nursing and health education design courses, and used computers as learning tools to guide learners to learn nursing and health knowledge. At the same time, two classes of nursing undergraduates were recruited to conduct a quasi-experiment. One of the classes was the experimental group, which used the generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT system for learning; the other class was the control group, which used traditional teaching methods for learning. By analyzing learners’ learning efficiency and learning satisfaction, we obtained results about the application effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT technology in a nursing education design course. According to the experimental results, the generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT system effectively improved learners’ critical thinking ability, problem solving, and learning enjoyment. These results indicate that the generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT system has great potential in nursing education design courses, and can improve the deficiencies of traditional teaching methods. © (2024), (International Forum of Educational Technology and Society).

This chapter explores the convergence of technology, society, and privacy as it digs into the complex world of ethical issues surrounding the use of generative AI. A wide range of concerns falls under the category of ethical considerations, such as the potential for social injustices to be amplified, biases present in training data, and the moral implications of content produced by artificial intelligence. This chapter explores how biases in training datasets might unintentionally reinforce societal preconceptions and provide discriminating results in AI-generated applications. Additionally, it looks at how organizations and developers can help reduce prejudice and guarantee fairness in generative AI systems. The chapter also explores the implications AI-generated content has for society, from text and images to full stories. The ethical implications of producing and sharing content that conflates real and artificial intelligence bring up issues with inaccuracy, manipulation, and potentially harmful applications. With a focus on protecting individual privacy, the chapter examines the fine line that must be drawn between fostering innovation and ensuring the welfare of society. Regarding privacy, the chapter discusses the risks posed by generative artificial intelligence, especially about safeguarding personal information. The chapter examines the possibility of privacy being exploited by creating synthetic content and highlights the necessity of strong security measures to prevent nefarious actors from compromising personal data. The chapter also encourages a proactive approach to addressing these issues by outlining developing best practices and current frameworks for ethical AI development. To create a responsible AI ecosystem that puts individual privacy first, it offers methods for incorporating explainability, accountability, and transparency into Generative AI systems. This chapter seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the direction of AI development by critically analyzing the ethical and privacy issues surrounding generative AI. To fully realize the transformational potential of generative AI while avoiding unforeseen repercussions, it emphasizes the significance of an ethical foundation and strong privacy safeguards. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Data privacy; Deepfakes; Fraud detection; Generative AI; Privacy-preserving","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212275553"

This systematic review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state, potential applications, and opportunities of Gen AI in patient care settings. This review aims to serve as a key resource for various stakeholders such as researchers, medical professionals, and data governance. We adopted the PRISMA review methodology and screened a total of 247 articles. After considering the eligibility and selection criteria, we selected 13 articles published between 2021 and 2024 (inclusive). The selection criteria were based on the inclusion of studies that report on the opportunities and challenges in improving PPCPs using Gen AI. We found that a holistic approach is required involving strategy, communications, integrations, and collaboration between AI developers, healthcare professionals, regulatory bodies, and patients. Developing frameworks that prioritize ethical considerations, patient privacy, and model transparency is crucial for the responsible deployment of Gen AI in healthcare. Balancing these opportunities and challenges requires collaboration between wider stakeholders to create a robust framework that maximizes the benefits of Gen AI in healthcare while addressing the key challenges and barriers such as explainability of the models, validation, regulation, and privacy integration with the existing clinical workflows. © 2024 by the authors.","clinical decision support; Gen AI; generative artificial intelligence; large language models (LLMs); opportunities and challenges of using generative AI; patient care; personalized patient care","Generative adversarial networks; Clinical decision support; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Opportunity and challenge of using generative AI; Patient care; Personalized patient care; Selection criteria","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211943151"

In regard to the emerging literature on GenAI, we explore 1) how established AI ethics principles are presented and 2) what new ethical principles have surfaced. The results indicate that established ethical principles continue to be relevant for GenAI systems but their salience and interpretation may shift, and that there is a need to recognize new principles in these systems. We identify six GenAI ethics principles: 1) respect for intellectual property, 2) truthfulness, 3) robustness, 4) recognition of malicious uses, 5) sociocultural responsibility, and 6) human-centric design. Addressing the challenge of satisfying multiple principles simultaneously, we suggest three meta-principles: categorizing and ranking principles to distinguish fundamental from supporting ones, mapping contradictions between principle pairs to understand their nature, and implementing continuous monitoring of fundamental principles due to the evolving nature of GenAI systems and their applications. To conclude, we suggest increased research emphasis on complementary ethics approaches to principlism, ethical tensions between different ethical viewpoints, end-user perspectives on the explainability and understanding of GenAI, and the salience of ethics principles to various GenAI stakeholders. © 2025, Association for Information Systems.

Generative AI has surpassed human capabilities in various tasks, offering a unique opportunity to address longstanding development barriers in construction management. Previous research has shown how generative AI can help with individual management tasks but a wider overview of how generative AI could help in construction management is still missing. By breaking down construction management into individual tasks and linking each task to available generative AI solutions, the study uncovers multiple innovative approaches to enhance current practices. Consequently, this research introduces the mapping of management tasks and explores a range of practical implications of generative AI on construction management. The research takes a mixed-methods approach, collaborating with industry professionals from Finnish construction companies through focus group discussions (FGD), and questionnaires to gather valuable feedback. The outcome is a pragmatic summary of seven management actions, connected with generative AI solutions, and their quantitative potentiality assessment. The results indicate an overall good potential for integrating generative AI into construction management, with AI-enhanced chair and secretary actions, communication and situational awareness, data analysis and improvement, and risk management receiving the highest perceived potentiality scores.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203688073"

First, it aims to deconstruct the reasons for distrust in GenAI in public administrations. The risks currently linked to GenAI in the public sector are often similar to those of conventional AI. However, while some risks remain pertinent, others are less so because GenAI has limited explainability, which, in return, limits its uses in public administrations. Confidentiality, marking of GenAI outputs and errors are specific matters for which responses should be technical as well as cultural, as they are pushing the boundaries of our instrumental conceptions of machines. Second, this article proposes some paradigm shifts in the perspective of using GenAI in public administrations due to the radical change caused by its language-based nature. GenAI represents a profound break from the “numerical” nature of AI systems implemented in public administrations to date. The transformative impact of GenAI on the intellectual production of the state raises fears of the replacement, or rather enslavement, of civil servants to machines. The article argues for the development of critical thinking as a specific skill for civil servants who have become highly specialized and will have to think with a machine that is eclectic by nature. It anticipates a transformation in the political nature of public administrations, which should lead to more considerations for the strategic stake related to training corpus and for our conceptualization of the neutrality of AI. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Generative artificial intelligence; Public administrations","Artificial intelligence; AI systems; Civil servants; Critical thinking; Generative artificial intelligence; Human machine interaction; Paradigm shifts; Public sector; Training corpus; Public administration","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182713455"

Recently Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) opens new possibilities for addressing the challenges of labeled data scarcity and accurate prediction in critical applications. However, a lack of diversity, as well as unrealistic and unreliable data, have a detrimental impact on performance. Therefore, this study proposes an augmentation scheme to address the scarcity of labeled data and data imbalance in medical datasets. This approach integrates the concepts of the Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid and pyramid blending with similarity measures. In order to maintain the structural properties of images and capture inter-variability of patient images of the same category similarity-metric-based intermixing has been introduced. It helps to maintain the overall quality and integrity of the dataset. Subsequently, deep learning approach with significant modification, that leverages transfer learning through the usage of concatenated pre-trained models is applied to classify breast cancer histopathological images. The effectiveness of the proposal, including the impact of data augmentation, is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of three different medical datasets, showing significant performance improvement over baseline models. The proposal has the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable approach for breast cancer diagnosis.

As GenAI technologies, such as ChatGPT, become increasingly integrated into educational settings, both in-service and future teachers are required to adapt to evolving classroom dynamics, where AI plays a significant role in content creation, personalized learning, and student engagement. However, existing literature often treats these factors in isolation, overlooking how they collectively influence teachers’ ability to effectively integrate GenAI into their pedagogical practices. This paper fills this gap by proposing a framework that categorizes teachers (including both pre- and in-service teachers, hereafter) into four roles—Observer, Adopter, Collaborator, and Innovator—each representing different levels of GenAI engagement, outlining teachers’ agencies in GenAI classrooms. By highlighting the need for quality teacher education programs, continuous professional development and institutional support, we use examples to demonstrate how teachers can evolve from basic GenAI users to co-creators of knowledge alongside GenAI systems. The findings emphasize that for GenAI to reach its full educational potential, teachers must not only accept and understand its capabilities but also integrate it deeply into their teaching practices.

We offer key lessons derived from these representations to inform clinicians, researchers, generative AI companies, policymakers and the public about the potential impacts of AI-generated imagery on mental health discourse. Methods We prompted two generative AI image models, Midjourney V.6 and DALL-E 3 with isolated diagnostic terms for common mental health conditions. The resulting images were compiled and presented as examples of current AI behaviour when interpreting psychiatric terminology. Findings The AI models generated image outputs for most psychiatric diagnosis prompts. These images frequently reflected cultural stereotypes and historical visual tropes including gender biases and stigmatising portrayals of certain mental health conditions. Discussion These findings illustrate three key points. First, generative AI models reflect cultural perceptions of mental disorders rather than evidence-based clinical ones. Second, AI image outputs resurface historical biases and visual archetypes. Third, the dynamic nature of these models necessitates ongoing monitoring and proactive engagement to manage evolving biases. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative effort among clinicians, AI developers and policymakers to ensure the responsible use of these technologies in mental health contexts. Clinical implications As these technologies become increasingly accessible, it is crucial for mental health professionals to understand AI’s capabilities, limitations and potential impacts. Future research should focus on quantifying these biases, assessing their effects on public perception and developing strategies to mitigate potential harm while leveraging the insights these models provide into collective understandings of mental illness. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.","Adult psychiatry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Mental Disorders; artificial intelligence; diagnosis; human; mental disease; psychology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211688473"

While people are getting very excited about impressive capabilities of this technology in creating textual content such as letters, reports and essays, there are concerns about the originality of the content produced by GAI, especially in the higher education sector. In response to this concern, this study takes an initial step through examining the originality reports of 60 essays generated by 5 different GAIs, namely, ChatGPT, YouChat, Chatosonic AI, Perplexity AI, and ChatGenie. To collect data, the study first chose one topic from each of four subject areas, namely, social science, mental health, organizational studies and computer science. Next, each of the 5 above-mentioned GAIs were asked to generate essays of 200, 500 and 1000 words for each topic, resulting in a total of 60 essays which were then submitted to the Turnitin plagiarism detection software. The results showed that while 16 essays were found to be plagiarism free, the other 44 had certain amount of plagiarism ranging from 3% to 47%. A correlation was observed between the word count of the text generated by GAI and the plagiarism percentage, with lower word counts showing a higher plagiarism percentage.

In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Digital equity; Generative artificial intelligence; Knowledge cocreation; Tribal Sovereignty","Decision making; Laws and legislation; Transparency; Artificial intelligence systems; Co-creation; Data governances; Digital equity; Generative artificial intelligence; Indigenous community; Information provision; Knowledge cocreation; System response; Tribal sovereignty; Knowledge representation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195306261"

The study solved the task of improving the communication mediation algorithms of chatbots through the comparison models of linguistic structures by users. Sometimes the user intentionally or due to lack of information forms an inaccurate request. Formally, this is described by logical operations “And” and “And or Not”. As a result of the research, a model was built comparing linguistic structures at the input with the information model of the response at the output. The modelwas basedon an approachwithrecursive creation of an answer. That has made it possible to determine the basic characteristics of the object of the request and form an answer on this basis. Using this approach improved the accuracy of the chatbot response. It also made it possible to consider the linguistic structure of the user through its formalization. The use of logic algebra made it possible to find typical errors of users during dialogs with generative artificial intelligence. A feature of the reported advancement is that the comparison of models of linguistic structures of query formation is carried out through a recurrent algorithm. As a result, it makes it possible to compare the query in such a way as to reduce the absolute error of the primary data by 0.02 % and simplify the process of mathematical calculations. At the same time, the received information becomes more accurate – the number of references increases from 2 to 6 sources. The proposal could be used in practical activities to improve the natural language recognition technologies of users in chatbots with generative artificial intelligence.

Workers with frequent internet usage and remote work are more concerned about AI-induced job risks. Sector-wise, entry-level employees perceive the least risk, whereas manufacturing professionals and senior service sector employees are more apprehensive. Contrary to the mainstream assumption that AI causes unemployment, this study identifies a potential complementary effect on job tasks, suggesting that AI can enhance and support human labor rather than replace it. This inference is based on observed worker perceptions and the increased use of AI tools in tasks that complement human skills. Moreover, AI's integration contributes to sustainable practices and entrepreneurial opportunities, enhancing business innovation and environmental efficiency.

The focus is on design creativity and practical feasibility. Six sets of prompts were used with Midjourney to generate lightweight two-wheeled vehicle concept ideas. To maintain conceptual ambiguity and flexibility during the early stages of design development, specific and conventional sub-categories of transportation vehicles were gradually obscured, while prompts describing the new design framework and component attributes were introduced progressively. Expert evaluations were conducted by ten bicycle or motorcycle design practitioners, who assessed creativity and practical feasibility using Likert scales and qualitative assessments. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in prompt implementation and creativity among the three concept ideas. Qualitative evaluations highlighted several challenges, including difficulties in assessing creativity when framework errors occur, excessive divergence in AI-generated content without the guidance of a clear conventional frame, the challenge for designers to keep pace with the fast and high-quality development efficiency of the AI tool, and AI’s limitations in judging feasibility and safety related to human factors. The study suggests the need for improved precision in prompt wording and enhancing the AI’s understanding of transportation design terminology. Generative AI still faces challenges in effectively supporting innovative design practices, particularly in addressing new framework details, component conflicts, and understanding professional terminology.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the Web of Science and Google Scholar databases to provide updated studies and expert authors to explore GenAI in the tourism industry. Analysing hyper-segmentation and hyper-personalization modalities through GenAI and their new challenges for tourists, tourism cities and companies. Findings: Findings reveal that GenAI technology exponentially improves consumers’ segmentation and personalization of products and services, allowing tourism cities and organizations to create tailored content in real-time. That is why the concept of hyper-segmentation is substantially focused on the customer (understood as a segment of one) and his or her preferences, needs, personal motivations and purchase antecedents, and it encourages companies to design tailored products and services with a high level of individual scalability and performance called hyper-personalization, never before seen in the tourism industry. Indeed, contextualizing the experience through GenAI is an important way to enhance personalization. Originality/value: This paper also contributes to enhancing and bootstrapping the literature on GenAI in the tourism industry because it is a new field of study, and its functional operability is in an incubation stage. Moreover, this viewpoint can facilitate researchers and companies to successfully integrate GenAI into different tourism and travel activities without expecting utopian results.

These GAI systems offer a chance for both educators and students to reevaluate their academic endeavors. Reevaluation of current practices is particularly pertinent in assessment within engineering instruction, where advanced generative text algorithms are proficient in addressing intricate challenges like those found in engineering courses. While this juncture presents a moment to revisit general assessment methods, the actual response of faculty to the incorporation of GAI in their evaluative techniques remains unclear. To investigate this, we have initiated a study delving into the mental constructs that engineering faculty hold about evaluation, focusing on their evolving attitudes and responses to GAI, as reported in the Fall of 2023. Adopting a long-term data-gathering strategy, we conducted a series of surveys, interviews, and recordings targeting the evaluative decision-making processes of a varied group of engineering educators across the United States. This paper presents the data collection process, our participants' demographics, our data analysis plan, and initial findings based on the participants' backgrounds, followed by our future work and potential implications. The analysis of the collected data will utilize qualitative thematic analysis in the next step of our study. Once we complete our study, we believe our findings will sketch the early stages of this emerging paradigm shift in the assessment of undergraduate engineering education, offering a novel perspective on the discourse surrounding evaluation strategies in the field. These insights are vital for stakeholders such as policymakers, educational leaders, and instructors, as they have significant ramifications for policy development, curriculum planning, and the broader dialogue on integrating GAI into educational evaluation. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Curricula; Generative adversarial networks; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence systems; Current practices; Data gathering; Engineering course; Engineering faculty; Engineering faculty members; Engineering instructions; Mental model; Paradigm shifts; Teaching methods; Engineering education","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202018341"

The authors sought to understand how students believe generative AI is acceptable to use in coursework. Materials and methods: Five faculty members surveyed students across health professions graduate programs using an updated, validated survey instrument. Students anonymously completed the survey online, which took 10–20 min. Data were then tabulated and reported in aggregate form. Results: Nearly 400 students from twelve academic programs including health and rehabilitation science, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistant studies, speech-language pathology, health administration and health informatics, undergraduate healthcare studies, nurse anesthesiology, and cardiovascular perfusion. The majority of students identify the threat of generative AI to graded assignments such as tests and papers, but many believe it is acceptable to use these tools to learn and study outside of graded assignments. Conclusions: Generative AI tools provide new options for students to study and learn. Graduate students in the health professions are currently using generative AI applications but are not universally aware or in agreement of how its use threatens academic integrity.

Additionally, G-AI platforms such as ChatGPT provide students with immediate support in understanding concepts and improving problem-solving abilities. However, it also opens up possibilities for students to improperly use the technology for homework and exams. This necessitates a revision in how educators design curricula and create assignments and projects. This paper discusses four teaching strategies integrated with G-AI; a) AI-assisted learning, b) Students evaluating AI generated solutions, c) Research-based learning with AI, and d) Open-ended project-based learning. Implementation of these strategies in electrical and robotics engineering technology courses such as circuits analysis, signal processing, and robotics systems is explored. These courses often require assignments that involve theoretical analysis and coding, solutions for which can easily be generated with AI. Therefore, employing these strategies in these courses is more important to effectively address plagiarism and enhance learning. An analysis comparing grade point average scores showed that student performance improved by 11.1% in the year 2023 when the proposed strategies were applied, compared to 2022 when the strategies were not implemented. This improvement was attributed to the in-class final exams conducted without access to textbooks or the internet, indicating that students had developed a solid understanding of the material and tackle final exam questions successfully.

These experiments are contextualized within academic debate where the authors have spent a significant part of their professional careers. Debate spans the gulf between many disciplines, takes place both within and beyond the classroom, and has been a site for pedagogical innovation throughout its history. It is thus an excellent space to address the challenges of GAI. The authors ultimately argue ChatGPT is neither a panacea nor a death knell for educational integrity.

Today higher education has become one of the spheres of active application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of modelling human cognitive activity to solve various tasks. The possibility of independent application of AI tools by students and teachers has become a prerequisite for changing the model of educational process realisation. Aim. The study aimed to investigate the attitudes of teachers and students to the use of widely available artificial intelligence tools in education on the example of Tomsk State University (TSU). Methodology and research methods. The main research methods were sociological and statistical methods. A survey of students and teaching staff of TSU was conducted. The study sample was 1597 students and 250 teachers. To check statistically significant differences between subsamples by socio-demographic characteristics, the Pearson Chi-squared criterion was used, as well as the Z-test for comparing proportions (at a significance level of 95%, p < 0.05). A comparative analysis was carried out between the subsamples, as well as between the results obtained from students and teaching staff. Results. The results of the research showed that students are more likely than teachers to have a positive attitude towards AI tools. Teachers are more inclined to pay attention to the risks and negative factors that the integration of AI in education may entail. The respondents with experience in using AI are more positive about such tools in education. Undergraduate students are more optimistic about the prospects for the implementation and use of AI in higher education. Students who completed coursework assignments using AI-enabled tools noted that most of the time teachers did not notice it. Both teachers and students admit that AI tools can be used as information processing aides without compromising educational outcomes. Scientific novelty consists in identifying teaching staff and student attitudes towards AI tools in wide access: risks and opportunities of such tools in education. Practical significance. The data obtained and the results of the analysis allow recording a cross-section of the existing attitude of students and teaching staff to the opportunities for using artificial intelligence in higher education. It can become one of the bases for the development of principles and strategies for working with the subjects of the educational process on the possibilities of using new technologies with AI in their activities, in particular, through the creation of methodological recommendations, professional development courses for teaching staff, educational modules for students. © Buyakova K.I., Dmitriev Ya.A., Ivanova A.S., Feshchenko A.V., Yakovleva K.I.","artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence tools for education; generative artificial intelligence; higher education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204651804"

Driven by the increasing integration of AI in education and the limited research on student perceptions, particularly in European contexts, this study aimed to understand how students view GenAI and its implications for higher education. The study employed a quantitative approach, using surveys to collect data on student attitudes toward AI across different fields of study, genders, and countries. A key innovation of this research is the development of a novel “Attitude toward AI” scale, designed to provide a robust and theoretically grounded instrument for measuring student perceptions of GenAI. The scale offers a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of AI integration in education. The results showed that students’ attitudes toward AI differed significantly based on their field of study and gender. Male students in technical sciences had the most positive attitudes toward AI adoption, indicating their potential to drive positive changes in AI implementation. While the effect size was small, this finding underscores the importance of considering individual factors when designing interventions to promote AI acceptance. The study underscored how prior experience shapes positive attitudes, highlighting the need for resources to familiarize students with GenAI and its ethics. The “Attitude toward AI” scale is a significant contribution addressing the lack of reliable instruments for assessing student perceptions of GenAI, enabling deeper understanding of factors influencing students’ adoption, informing targeted interventions for different student groups. Further research is needed on GenAI’s long-term impact. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; attitudes scale; ChatGPT; GenAI tools; student attitudes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214908653"

To do so, a study is made to see the general behavioral patterns vis-à-vis cross-cultural factors in two campuses in Indonesia and the Philippines using the following methods: 1) behavioral mapping (BM) to record landscape activities data, 2) literature review to create the coding system, and 3) generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) application to aid generate images for the recommendations. The time frame, time-frequency, density, facilities, academic greenspace codes, and images were recorded using the BM. The study revealed that outdoor recreation in academic greenspaces is experienced in disparate physical spaces with various combinations of four dimensions: social space, symbolic space, active space, and experience space. The devised coding system helped align the study areas, determining commonalities, dissimilarities, and unusual findings. Common lacking features extracted from the data analysis were used as text prompts, while site images were used as image prompts. Using the prompts, landscape scenarios were generated using the GenAI application-Midjourney.

Using a dataset from the National Diet Library (NDL) consisting of 1,000 to 1.2 million samples, the research evaluated the impact of training data volume on classification accuracy. Fine-tuning was conducted using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model with default parameter settings. Results indicated that even with 1,000 training samples, the model could correctly assign NDC division (two-digit) numbers to about half of the books, achieving over 70% accuracy for NDC class (one-digit) numbers. As the number of training samples increased, accuracy improved logarithmically, reaching 70.5% with 800,000 samples. However, when the sample size reached 1.2 million, there was only a marginal improvement observed to 70.7%. This trend was consistent across NDC class, division, and section (three-digit) levels, with more pronounced improvements observed in the more detailed classification levels. This study not only highlights the potential of generative AI for library classification tasks, but also suggests that more training data may not necessarily lead to a substantial improvement in accuracy. The findings indicate that while generative AI holds potential for automating library classification, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality and volume of the data used for training. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Automatic classification number assignment; generative AI; Nippon Decimal Classification","Generative adversarial networks; Automatic classification; Automatic classification number assignment; Classification accuracy; Classification system; Data volume; Fine tuning; Generative artificial intelligence; Nippon decimal classification; Training data; Training sample; Data accuracy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213066567"

Chief among the questions examined is whether AI offers a viable path forward toward greater research publication equity but, at the same time, something much more fraught. In other words, the paper explores how promising the apparent equalizing potential of generative AI may be. Might, for example, generative AI offer a smoother path to visibility, but in so doing, actually make the uniqueness of diverse scholars’ contributions far less visible? The paradoxical potential of generative AI is discussed first in this paper by surveying, at this particular phase of AI development, some of the salient advantages of generative AI use for research prewriting, writing, and post-writing, that is, AI’s ability to assist with such essentials as idea generation, text development, and text refinement. The apparent democratizing advantages of AI for each of these major stages of research writing are then interrogated and problematized.

It recommends that guidelines for using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in mental health care must be established promptly. Currently, clinicians using chatbots without appropriate approval risk undermining legal protections for patients. This could harm the patient and undermine the standards of the profession, undermining trust in an area where human involvement in decision-making is critical. To explore these concerns, this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act) is also considered. It will be seen that these laws are insufficient in the context of mental health.

Educators and researchers of online, blended, and in-person learning are still coming to grips with how to employ current AI technologies in the learning experience, let alone understanding the potential consequences that future and unknown developments in AI will produce. Despite potential risks, AI may revolutionize previous models of teaching and learning, and perhaps create opportunities to realize progressive educational goals. Given the longstanding tradition of using philosophy to examine questions surrounding ethics, ontology, technology, and education, the purpose of this critical reflection paper is to draw from prominent philosophers across these disciplines to address the question: how can AI be employed in future educational contexts in a humanizing and ethical manner? Drawing from the work of Gunther Anders, Michel Foucault, Paolo Freire, Benjamin Bloom, and Hannah Arendt, we propose a framework for assessing the use and ethics of AI in modern education contexts regarding human versus AI generated textual and multimodal content, and the broader political, social, and cultural implications.

Analysis of pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, which encompassed a mix of open and closed items to gather participants’ knowledge and perceptions of utilising GenAI tools, as well as the follow-up interviews, revealed that the intervention was effective in stretching all aspects of pre-service teachers’ P-GenAI-C. While there was greater evidence of improvement in participants’ pedagogical competence and critical awareness of GenAI tools deployment, there was less evidence of development in other aspects, such as teachers’ capacity to guide their students to use GenAI tools effectively and responsibly.

Amend if necessary. Insights from EDM are based on data collected from educational environments. Among these educational environments are computer-based educational systems (CBES) such as learning management systems (LMS) and conversational intelligent tutoring systems (CITSs). The use of large language models (LLMs) to power a CITS holds promise due to their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These systems offer opportunities for enriching management and entrepreneurship education. Collecting data from classes experimenting with these new technologies raises some ethical challenges. This paper presents an EDM framework for analyzing and evaluating the impact of these LLM-based CITS on learning experiences in management and entrepreneurship courses and also places strong emphasis on ethical considerations. The different learning experience aspects to be tracked are (1) learning outcomes and (2) emotions or affect and sentiments. Data sources comprise Learning Management System (LMS) logs, pre-post-tests, and reflection papers gathered at multiple time points. This framework aims to deliver actionable insights for course and curriculum design and development through design science research (DSR), shedding light on the LLM-based system’s influence on student learning, engagement, and overall course efficacy. Classes targeted to apply this framework have 30–40 students on average, grouped between 2 and 6 members. They will involve sophomore to senior students aged 18–22 years. One entire semester takes about 14 weeks. Designed for broad application across diverse courses in management and entrepreneurship, the framework aims to ensure that the utilization of LLMs in education is not only effective but also ethically sound. © The Author(s) 2024.","ChatGPT; CITS; Conversational intelligent tutoring systems; Design science research; GenAI; Generative AI; GPT; Large language models; LLM","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Federated learning; Information management; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Records management; Research and development management; Teaching; ChatGPT; Conversational intelligent tutoring system; Design-science researches; GenAI; Generative AI; GPT; Intelligent tutoring; Language model; Large language model; Tutoring system; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202592807"

Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. As a result, assessment reform has become a pressing topic in the GenAI era. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from “no AI” to “full AI, ” enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking. The pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI and enhanced student engagement with GenAI technology. The AIAS facilitated a shift in pedagogical practices, with faculty members incorporating GenAI tools into their modules and students producing innovative multimodal submissions. The findings suggest that the AIAS can support the effective integration of GenAI in higher education, promoting academic integrity while leveraging technology’s potential to enhance learning experiences. Implications for practice or policy: • Higher education institutions should adopt flexible frameworks like the AIAS to guide ethical integration of GenAI into assessment practices. • Educators should design assessments that leverage GenAI capabilities, while supporting critical thinking and human input. • Institutional policies related to GenAI should be developed in consultation with stakeholders and regularly updated to keep pace with technological advancements. • Policymakers should prioritise research funding into the impacts of GenAI on higher education to inform evidence-based practices.

It was concluded that it depended on specific circumstances, but it was noted that students might potentially undermine their own learning by relying on tools like ChatGPT to answer questions and compose papers. This paper addresses how to enable students to use these tools in a way that students are not cheating themselves. The introduction of calculators into the classroom in the early 1970s stimulated discussion on ethical use of technology in teaching. A similar revolution is occurring with the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, Bard (now Gemini), and many others, and a similar set of opportunities is emerging. A key issue is how to use GenAI tools constructively to encourage critical thinking in the solving of engineering problems. The tools can make it easier to differentiate instruction to meet the diverse needs of students and tailor teaching to students with different levels of skills. Using Generative AI tools can help build students' confidence in their own abilities to function as engineers. For example, students can analyze a problem from a variety of perspectives by varying the prompts they give to their GenAI tool. In this paper, we investigated the potential impact of GenAI on a master's class in cybersecurity by allowing the students to generate questions for three different large language models and analyzing the results. Additionally, we discuss some actions taken in our classes, including changing the style of assessments, teaching students “prompt engineering” as part of the critical thinking process, teaching students how to use Generative AI effectively in coding, and helping students to acquire the habit of validating outputs from Gen AI tools to eliminate hallucinations and fake references. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Engineering education; Ethical technology; Generative adversarial networks; Problem solving; Teaching; Artificial intelligence tools; Critical thinking; Cyber security; Engineering problems; Key Issues; Language model; Potential impacts; Thinking process; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202031574"

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence literacy; Extended technology acceptance model; Generative artificial intelligence tools; Teacher development; Teaching and learning","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Generative adversarial networks; Artificial intelligence literacy; Artificial intelligence tools; Behavioral intention; Extended technology acceptance models; Generative artificial intelligence tool; Self efficacy; Subjective norm; Teacher development; Teachers'; Teaching and learning; Contrastive Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208282259"

They offer students a way to engage with their course material in a way that feels fluent and instinctive. Whilst educators may have views on the appropriates for AI, the tools themselves, as well as the novel ways in which they can be used, are continually changing. Methods: The aim of this study was to probe students' familiarity with AI tools, their views on its current uses, their understanding of universities' AI policies, and finally their impressions of its importance, both to their degree and their future careers. We surveyed 453 psychology and sport science students across two institutions in the UK, predominantly those in the first and second year of undergraduate study, and conducted a series of five focus groups to explore the emerging themes of the survey in more detail. Results: Our results showed a wide range of responses in terms of students' familiarity with the tools and what they believe AI tools could and should not be used for. Most students emphasized the importance of understanding how AI tools function and their potential applications in both their academic studies and future careers. The results indicated a strong desire among students to learn more about AI technologies. Furthermore, there was a significant interest in receiving dedicated support for integrating these tools into their coursework, driven by the belief that such skills will be sought after by future employers. However, most students were not familiar with their university's published AI policies. Discussion: This research on pedagogical methods supports a broader long-term ambition to better understand and improve our teaching, learning, and student engagement through the adoption of AI and the effective use of technology and suggests a need for a more comprehensive approach to communicating these important guidelines on an on-going basis, especially as the tools and guidelines evolve.

The study is aimed at the implementation of AI within university settings and its impact on both educators and students. Given the swift integration of AI, notably the widespread adoption of generative AI in higher education, the article emphasises AI's ability to collect detailed data, providing a deeper understanding of academicians' learning experiences. This, in turn, enables personalised support, allowing academicians to respond more effectively to students' needs and improve the overall educational process. Moreover, the research highlights AI's potential to proactively identify students at risk of failure, offering academicians a comprehensive view for more effective assessment. On the other hand, these advantages and the growing dependence on technology pose challenges, including reduced interaction between academicians and students, shifts in workforce dynamics, concerns about student privacy and disparities in technology access. Acknowledging these issues, the study underscores the importance of preparing academicians and students for the evolving landscape of higher education shaped by AI. It stresses the need for proactive measures to navigate these changes effectively, as they are inevitable. The findings of this study are significant for the field of higher education, as they provide a clear and critical assessment of AI's transformative potential and advocate for proactive measures to navigate the changes effectively. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","academicians; artificial intelligence; higher education; qualitative study","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210949575"

An area of investigation of particular interest for constitutional science is that of representative assemblies, with respect to which the possible impact of generative AI induces some reflections on the functions they perform and, more generally, on their place in the system of the constitutional state. This contribution focuses on the level of the control and direction functions of ‘AI powered’ parliaments. The premise of the reasoning is that the use of generative AI makes it possible, among other things - albeit with all the cautions and requirements imposed by the peculiar nature of parliamentary activities - to strengthen, to a quantitatively and qualitatively unprecedented extent, the activity of collecting, processing and summarising data and information, which represent a necessary resource for the effective and efficient exercise of these functions, especially in the age of complexity in decision-making. If so, it will be argued that the new technology can act as a compensatory tool for the ‘double information asymmetry’ in which the representative assemblies, and their members, find themselves in vis-à-vis both the executive and the technical-bureaucratic bodies, thus playing a role in rebalancing the form of government. We will then analyse some approaches (evidence-based policymaking), tools (related to the evaluation of public policies, the quality of regulation, stakeholder consultation) and institutional evolutions (the NRRP experience and the reform of european economic governance) with respect to which the hypothesis of a virtuous integration of generative AI in parliamentary procedures seems more concrete and suitable. © 2024, Societa Editoriale Federalismi s.r.l.

By the year 2050, many societies around the world may be highly information-literate and AI-literate. While disinformation campaigns may still occur, and, by that point, very sophisticated deepfakes will very likely be used, coalitions across disciplinary, sectoral, cultural, and global boundaries will work together to expose deception. These coalitions will unite the fields of technology and sciences with social sciences and humanities, creating effective tools to counter disinformation campaigns by coupling technological tools with interdisciplinary approaches. Analogously, interdisciplinary and global coalitions will effectively work together to mitigate and perhaps even eradicate many other pervasive mega-crises that plague the world today, such as poverty, extremism, degradation of the natural environment, etc. The PR/strategic communication field can and should be at the forefront of the developments toward the forecasted future.

Changes to the profession accelerated during COVID-19, a time during which there was a rapid increase in the use of cloud-based virtual collaboration platforms (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams) for telehealth services as well as virtual teaching and research activities. Technology continues to advance swiftly, and the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (genAI), is creating profound changes in all aspects of society, including the psychology profession. With these changes come questions about how to practice ethically as a clinician, as a teacher, and as a researcher. In this article, we explore the ethical principles and standards of most relevance to genAI use in the activities of psychologists (clinical, teaching, research) across settings (private practice, hospitals, colleges/universities, research centers). Ethical issues and questions are presented within the context of the current American Psychological Association’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (2017), which is under revision. Recommendations are provided for approaching ethical concerns amidst the rapid technological advances that are changing the way psychologists do their work. Psychologists’ use of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) can benefit society by, for example, increasing access to mental health services, improving diagnosis and treatment planning, advancing psychological science, and supporting education and training. However, ethical challenges exist. This article explores the potential benefits and ethical challenges of genAI within the psychology profession and offers recommendations for incorporating genAI into psychological practices in ways that promote positive, and avoid detrimental, outcomes for society.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is seen as the solution that will bring personalised learning to all learners. Here, we argue that GenAI may not only fall short of this expectation but also hinder the development of the competencies necessary to unlock learners’ potential. Our first argument posits that although personalised learning aims to diversify instruction to meet the needs of individual learners, the indiscriminate use of GenAI risks homogenising learners’ performance and creativity, limiting the discovery of their potential. We argue that effective use of GenAI requires curiosity, critical thinking, self-regulation and metacognition. Our second argument is that these skills are not enhanced by GenAI but rather might suffer from its unregulated use. Thus, while GenAI has considerable potential to enhance learning, learners will not reap these benefits by default. Instead, to make the most of the opportunities GenAI offers, the education system must invest more in developing human skills rather than technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Critical Thinking; Curiosity; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Metacognition; Personalised Learning; Self-regulated Learning","Cognitive systems; Learning systems; Critical thinking; Curiosity; Enhance learning; Generative artificial intelligence; Metacognition; Performance; Personalizations; Personalized learning; Self regulation; Self-regulated learning; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200649783"

The research involved two independent samples of university students in Türkiye, with data collected through scales and analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The final scale, comprising 33 items, was categorized into four factors: Learning/Utility, Enjoyment, Usefulness, and Interest. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance across genders. The findings indicate no significant gender differences in attitudes toward GenAI, suggesting a general acceptance of GenAI technologies among EFL learners. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between daily internet usage and attitudes toward GenAI. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on GenAI in language education and offers practical implications for integrating GenAI into language learning, highlighting the importance of fostering positive attitudes for successful technology adoption.

Therefore, methodological guidelines and more empirical experiences are needed to better understand these tools and know how to use them to their fullest potential. This contribution presents an exploratory and correlational study conducted with 37 computer science students who used ChatGPT as a support tool to learn database administration. The article addresses three questions: The first one explores the degree of use of ChatGPT among computer science students to learn database administration, the second one explores the profile of students who get the most out of tools like ChatGPT to deal with database administration activities, and the third one explores how the utilization of ChatGPT can impact in academic performance. To empirically shed light on these questions the student’s grades and a comprehensive questionnaire were employed as research instruments. The obtained results indicate that traditional learning resources, such as teacher’s explanations and student’s reports, were widely used and correlated positively with student’s grades. The usage and perceived utility of ChatGPT were moderate, but positive correlations between students’ grades and ChatGPT usage were found. Indeed, a significantly higher use of this tool was identified among the group of outstanding students. This indicate that high-performing students are the ones who are using ChatGPT the most. So, a new digital trench could be rising between these students and those with a lower degree of fundamentals and worse prompting skills, who may not take advantage of all the ChatGPT possibilities. © 2024 by the authors.","ChatGPT; educational technologies; GenAI","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213448511"

In this sense, this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes: Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots; impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning, conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges, and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy, and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require further exploration. Accordingly, it’s in this praxis that emotional intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues. Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools.

The AIGC mainly come two main streams: Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. New application and research publish daily in an accelerated way. In this paper, we first raise a serious question over LLMs: Does intelligent ability generated from LLMs really owns general artificial intelligence (AGI, artificial general intelligence) ability like ordinary people’s intelligence ability doing things? In this paper, I first make an important hypothesis: As a closed system, through a large language model (LLM) has been designed to represent, store human’s huge knowledge and intelligence’s ability and behavior, equipped with the highest value standard that the model must align to human value, but the LLM model doesn’t demonstrate its AGI ability. However, as an opened system, once we input some formatted text with implicit human’s knowledge and intelligence, then we suddenly find that output of the LLM model show natures of certain human’s intelligence and behavior. The formatted input text is called a prompt. The higher intelligent prompt is, the better intelligent output of the model will be. In other words, the LLM models own some kind of AGI ability conditioned on prompt. Economics research and other social science research such as politics, history, and linguistics include the most complex social forms and the deepest human minds, so in this paper, we try to explore whether AGI-like general AI for large language models LLMs is a fact or an illusion by summarizing the latest research results of other researchers? For this model’s AGI-like general AI capabilities, we summarize the latest research results of these research scholars, including issues such as IQ levels of large language models, AIGC industrial economics, computational social science research under AIGC, business decision making, and virtual AIGC economist paradigm research in economics and other social sciences. © 2024 Chinese Chemical Society.

Demonstrating remarkable performance in medical exams globally, these models show potential for educational applications. However, their effectiveness in non-English contexts, particularly in Chile's Medical Licensing Exam, a critical step for medical practitioners in Chile, is less explored. This gap highlights the need to evaluate ChatGPT's adaptability to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the proficiency of ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4V in answering EUNACOM (Examen Único Nacional de Conocimientos de Medicina), a major medical examination in Chile. Methods: Three official practice drills (540 questions) from the University of Chile, mirroring the EUNACOM structure and difficulty, were used to test ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4V. The three ChatGPT versions underwent three attempts of answering each drill. Responses to questions during each round were systematically categorized and analyzed to assess the accuracy rate of the responses. Results: All versions of ChatGPT passed the EUNACOM drills, with version 4 and version 4V outperforming version 3.5 (P<.001). Version 4V, however, was not better than version 4 (P=.730), despite the additional functionality of being able to use the figures of the questions. We also evaluated the performance by different medical areas of EUNACOM and found that versions 4 and 4V consistently outperformed version 3.5. Across the different medical areas, version 3.5 displayed the highest accuracy in Psychiatry (69.84%) while versions 4 and 4V achieved the highest accuracy in Surgery (90.00% and 86.11%, respectively). We found that version 3.5 and version 4 had the lowest performance in Internal Medicine (52.74% and 75.62%, respectively), while version 4V had the lowest performance in Public Health (74.07%). Conclusions: The study reveals ChatGPT's ability to pass the EUNACOM test, with distinct proficiencies across versions 3.5, 4, and 4V. Notably, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) don't significantly enhance image-based question performance. The variations in proficiency across medical fields suggest the need for more nuanced AI training. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of exploring innovative approaches to using AI for augmenting human cognition and enhancing the learning process. Such advancements have the potential to significantly influence medical education, fostering not only knowledge acquisition but also the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among healthcare professionals. © The authors.

The generated contents are constrained, which limits their dimensionality. In this scenario, duplicated contents are eliminated from the automatic creations. Furthermore, the generated ratios are utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors, hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios. These scenarios involve generating large patterns and reducing the dynamic patterns with an enhanced accuracy of 97% in the projected model.

It looks at how GenAI is deployed within SCM and the challenges that have been encountered, in addition to the ethics. Moreover, this paper also discusses the problems that AI can pose once used in SCM, for instance, the quality of data used, and the ethical concerns that come with, the use of AI in SCM. A grasp of the specifics of how GenAI operates as well as how to implement it successfully in the supply chain is essential in assessing the performance of this relatively new technology as well as prognosticating the future of generation AI in supply chain planning. © 2024 by author(s).","Artificial Intelligence (AI); generative AI models; industrial applications; supply chain management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205956622"

Design: Cross-sectional study, including 54 MEDLINE-indexed PM&R journals, selected by searching “Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine” as a broad subject term for indexed journals. Non-English journals, conference-related journals, and those not primarily focused on PM&R were excluded. Setting: PM&R journals. Participants: Not applicable. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Reviewing policies regarding the use of AI and comparing CiteScore, Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP), Scientific Journal Ranking (SJR), and Impact Factor (IF) between journals with an AI policy and those without. Results: Of the 54 PM&R journals, only 46.3% had an AI policy. Among these, none completely banned AI use or allowed unlimited use without a declaration. Most journals (52%) permitted AI for manuscript editing with a required declaration, 44% allowed unlimited AI use with a declaration, and only 4% allowed AI-assisted editing without any declaration. No significant difference was found in scientometric scores between journals considered with and without AI policies (P>.05). Conclusions: Under half of MEDLINE-indexed PM&R journals had guidelines regarding the use of AI. None of the journals with AI policies entirely prohibited its use, nor did they allow unrestricted use without a declaration. Journals with defined AI policies did not demonstrate higher citation rates or affect scores. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Guideline; Journals; Machine Learning; Rehabilitation","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215207506"

Generative AI (GenAI), in particular, is revolutionising content creation in second language (L2) writing instruction through advanced machine learning models. This study examines the influence of GenAI on L2 learners' language competencies, focusing on tools commonly used by first-year English for Academic Purposes students. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, including surveys and interviews, this research explored students’ experiences and perceptions of GenAI tools, including Grammarly and Quillbot. The findings revealed that two-thirds of the students (66.7%) regularly used these tools, which they found particularly helpful for improving grammar, writing, vocabulary, and reading skills. Interview insights indicated that the students appreciated the personalised feedback and creative support provided by GenAI tools, although they also acknowledged risks such as irrelevant feedback and potential overreliance. We suggest that while GenAI tools enhance language learning by providing personalised and adaptive support, they should complement rather than replace traditional methods.

Although these tools offer benefits such as time-saving and improved quality, with over 100 available applications, they may inadvertently include borrowed content, posing challenges to academic integrity. Ethical concerns arise within educational institutions, faculty, and integrity committees, complicating evaluations of originality. To address these concerns, universities must establish clear guidelines and educational programs for responsible use of GenAI applications. Educators need to remain current with the latest AI technologies, become proficient in their use, and utilize advanced techniques to teach students how to use them appropriately. This mixed-methods study examines undergraduate engineering students' understanding of GenAI, its usage and ethical implications. The findings demonstrate that ChatGPT is the most popular GenAI application among the students, but also highlight the professors' unfavorable attitudes towards GenAI.

Drawing on five key international documents from the UN, EU, and OECD, the study used content analysis to identify key ethical dimensions related to the use of generative AI in academia, such as accountability, human oversight, transparency, or inclusiveness. Empirical evidence was compiled from 30 leading universities ranked among the top 500 in the Shanghai Ranking list from May to July 2023, covering those institutions that already had publicly available responses to these dimensions in the form of policy documents or guidelines. The paper identifies the central ethical imperative that student assignments must reflect individual knowledge acquired during their education, with human individuals retaining moral and legal responsibility for AI-related wrongdoings. This top-down requirement aligns with a bottom-up approach, allowing instructors flexibility in determining how they utilize generative AI especially large language models in their own courses. Regarding human oversight, the typical response identified by the study involves a blend of preventive measures (e.g., course assessment modifications) and soft, dialogue-based sanctioning procedures. The challenge of transparency induced the good practice of clear communication of AI use in course syllabi in the first university responses examined by this study. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200460071"

While most studies focus on the potential impact on academic integrity, this work explored constructive applications of ChatGPT in the design of instructional materials for courses in academic information literacy. The starting point was the use of openly licenced information resources or content infrastructure as facilitators in the creation of educational materials. In the first phase, course teaching material was developed using a prompt engineering strategy, predefined standards, and a prompt script. As a second step, we experimented with designing a custom chatbot model connected to a pre-defined corpus of source documents. The results demonstrated that the final teaching material required careful revision and optimisation before use in an actual instructional programme. The experimental design of the custom chatbot was able to query specific user-defined documents.

With this in mind, this study set out to explore the effects of AI’s applications (ChatGPT a case in focus) as educational scaffolding in developing database management skills at the undergraduate level in Saudi Arabia. A quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental design was used for two equal groups to determine the effects, and a survey was used to collect the experimental group’s opinions about the pros and cons of ChatGPT in learning database management. The sample consisted of 98 students from the College of Computer Science at a Saudi University, randomly distributed into experimental and control groups, each of 49 students. The experimental results showed a medium-sized effect of ChatGPT on the cognitive aspect. Results also show that ChatGPT affects, to a large extent, students’ performance in database management. In the study, both positive and negative aspects of ChatGPT are evident. The most notable positives include enabling learners to solve content problems, saving time and effort, and enhancing self-learning opportunities. The negative aspects include plagiarism, lack of Arabic language support, and weakening of students’ research skills. In closing, the study recommended using ChatGPT in database management learning and solving relevant problems. It also recommends directing learners on how to avoid the negative aspects that result from overreliance on ChatGPT without effort from learners. © 2024 TEMPUS Publications.","artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; generative AI; SQL language","Adversarial machine learning; Database systems; Engineering education; Federated learning; Students; ChatGPT; Database management; Experimental groups; Generative artificial intelligence; Learning database; Management skills; Performance; Quantitative approach; Saudi Arabia; SQL languages; Contrastive Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206001669"

LAMB addresses critical gaps in existing educational AI solutions by providing a framework specifically designed for the unique requirements of the education sector. It introduces novel features, including a modular architecture for seamless integration of AI assistants into existing LMS platforms and an intuitive interface for educators to create custom AI assistants without coding skills. Unlike existing AI tools in education, LAMB provides a comprehensive framework that addresses privacy concerns, ensures alignment with institutional policies, and promotes using authoritative sources. LAMB leverages the capabilities of large language models and associated generative artificial intelligence technologies to create generative intelligent learning assistants that enhance educational experiences by providing personalized learning support based on clear directions and authoritative fonts of information. Key features of LAMB include its modular architecture, which supports prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and the creation of extensive knowledge bases from diverse educational content, including video sources. The development and deployment of LAMB were iteratively refined using a minimum viable product approach, exemplified by the learning assistant: “Macroeconomics Study Coach,” which effectively integrated lecture transcriptions and other course materials to support student inquiries. Initial validations in various educational settings demonstrate the potential that learning assistants created with LAMB have to enhance teaching methodologies, increase student engagement, and provide personalized learning experiences. The system's usability, scalability, security, and interoperability with existing LMS platforms make it a robust solution for integrating artificial intelligence into educational environments. LAMB's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation among educators, researchers, and developers, fostering a community dedicated to advancing the role of artificial intelligence in education.

From the terminologist’s point of view, the strategic use of GenAI tools can streamline the process of crafting definitions, reducing both time and effort, while potentially enhancing quality. GenAI tools enable AI-assisted terminography, notably post-editing terminography, where the machine produces a definition that the terminologist then corrects or refines. However, the potential of GenAI tools to fulfill all the terminological needs of a user, including term definitions, challenges the very existence of terminological definitions and resources as we know them. Unlike terminological definitions, GenAI tools can describe the knowledge activated by a term in a specific context. However, a main drawback of these tools is that their output can contain errors. For this reason, users requiring reliability will likely still resort to terminological resources for definitions. Nevertheless, with the inevitable integration of AI into terminology work, the distinction between human-created and AI-created content will become increasingly blurred. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","AI-assisted terminography; ChatGPT; Generative Artificial Intelligence; terminological definition","Artificial intelligence; AI-assisted terminography; Artificial intelligence tools; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; Post-editing; Terminological definition; Terminology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196111758"

However, its application in the education domain was initially met with resistance due to concerns about disrupting traditional learning and assessment methods, raising questions about academic integrity, and provoking ethical dilemmas related to data privacy and bias. Many schools, higher educational institutions, and governments initially chose to ban the use of GenAI tools due to the disruptions they caused to learning and teaching practices, only to rescind their bans later. This study conducts a literature review to investigate GenAI tools from the perspectives of key stakeholders in the educational domain— students, educators, and administrators—highlighting their benefits while identifying challenges and limitations. The review found several benefits of using GenAI, such as personalised learning, immediate support, language support, and reduced administrative workload. This paper also provides usage guidelines for stakeholders and outlines future research areas to support GenAI adoption in higher education. Our findings indicate that most studies involving students had a positive view of using GenAI. There is a noticeable gap in research focusing on administrators, highlighting the need for further investigation. © 2024.

To bridge this gap, the present study conducted in-depth interviews with 17 university English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in mainland China, and scrutinized their different phases of teaching for any GenAI involvement. Through the lens of the ADDIE model (i.e., analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation), it was found that GenAI tools were mainly involved in the development stage (e.g., devising teaching activities and developing teaching materials). During the implementation stage, teachers merely introduced GenAI tools to their students, through means such as demonstrations and workshops, indicating a lack of organic integration of those tools into curriculum-based activities. GenAI involvement in the other three stages of instruction was reported to be none to minimal. The participants also shared both positive and negative experiences with GenAI in their EFL instruction. These findings highlight the urgent need for providing stage-specific professional training on how to integrate GenAI into different instructional stages and developing specialized educational GenAI programs that can produce accurate and high-quality outputs.

A particular area of concern is the impact of AI systems on intellectual property rights (IPRs) as infringement might occur in relation to the use of AI systems. IPR infringements can be committed by training an AI system, as well as by using or when operating an AI system. This raises the question of liability for such IPR infringements. • This research covers situations where IPR infringements are committed by training an AI system, as well as those where infringements are committed by using or operating an AI system. One hypothetical situation of an AI system created solely for the purpose of infringing IPRs is investigated, but also includes situations where otherwise legitimate AI systems are misused in criminal activities as tools for the production and sale of infringing goods. These areas are analysed in relation to the proposed AI Liability Directive and other relevant European Union legislation to identify what rules would be applicable to liability for damage in such cases. The research also considers the recently enacted AI Act. In instances where the damage is caused by AI-enabled products and services, the study shows how the ‘rebuttable presumption of causality’ provided for under the AI Liability Directive could be applied. © The Author(s) 2024.

However, traditional tools for creating teaching materials are mutually independent and lack sufficient intelligence, resulting in low efficiency and limited adaptability. This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence(GAI)-based teaching material system(TMGS) to create materials for both teachers and students in a human-in-the-loop model. The TMGS comprises three modules: pre-class material generation, in-class material generation, and post-class material generation. The pre-class module assists teachers in creating well-structured teaching plans, while the in-class module provides valuable resources for both teachers and students during lessons. The post-class module focuses on delivering personalized assignments to students. Throughout all stages, teachers play a critical role in reviewing the generated materials. To evaluate the system's performance, we conducted materials generation on the topic of 'inverse proportion' in primary school mathematics by utilizing large language models like GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that the system exhibits excellent comprehensiveness, efficiency, and adaptability.  © 2023 IEEE.","generative artificial intelligence; human-in-the-loop model; large language models; teaching material generation","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Efficiency; Generative artificial intelligence; Human-in-the-loop; Human-in-the-loop model; Language model; Large language model; Loop models; Material systems; Teachers'; Teaching material generations; Teaching materials; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184659801"

This study explores the potential of leveraging VR technologies and generative AI (GenAI) to overcome these barriers. EasyEnglish is a real-time conversation game with GenAI non-player character (NPC)s. This game utilizes voice input recognition, large language model (LLM) for language assessment and text-to-speech (TTS) for NPC lip-sync animation. The content validity was assessed by 3 experts to evaluate the conversation quality. A usability test was conducted using a purposive sampling method with 7 undergraduate non-native English speakers who have less than 1 year experience in using VR technology. This study employed System Usability Scale (SUS) and Content Validity Index (CVI) metrics for assessment. The CVI result showed satisfactory agreement in conversation quality but highlighted areas for improvement in learning objectives. The SUS result revealed satisfaction in consistency of user interface (UI) and learnability of EasyEnglish, while also highlighting the need for improvement in UI, setup, and visual cues. The significance of the study lies in the GenAI's ability to provide diverse response, avoid repetitive dialogue and speak using gestures to undergraduate students. GenAI effectively identify and assess irrelevant words in conversation, provide immediate grammar and vocabulary correction and suggestion of conversation improvement accurately. Future research should focus on improving accessibility, include more multimodal interactions, and mapping learning objectives with the soft skills emphasized by the World Economic Forum (WEF). © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

In higher education (HE), the advent of GenAI presents a pivotal moment that may profoundly alter learning and teaching practices in aspects such as inaccuracy, bias, overreliance on technology and algorithms, and limited access to educational AI resources that require in-depth investigation. To evaluate the implications of adopting GenAI in HE, a team of academics and field experts have co-authored this paper, which analyzes the potential for the responsible integration of GenAI into HE and provides recommendations about this integration. This paper recommends strategies for integrating GenAI into HE to create the following positive outcomes: raise awareness about disruptive change, train faculty, change teaching and assessment practices, partner with students, impart AI learning literacies, bridge the digital divide, and conduct applied research. Finally, we propose four preliminary scale levels of a GenAI adoption for faculty. At each level, we suggest courses of action to facilitate progress to the next stage in the adoption of GenAI. This study offers a valuable set of recommendations to decision-makers and faculty, enabling them to prepare for the responsible and judicious integration of GenAI into HE. © 2024 by the authors.","academic teaching; Generative AI; generative AI (GenAI); higher education (HE)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194264772"

Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI-TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","artificial intelligence; generative adversarial network; spotted hyena optimization; stock market prediction; time series forecasting","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Effective tool; Forecasting techniques; Hyper-parameter; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Optimization techniques; Spotted hyena optimization; Stock market prediction; Time series forecasting; Times series; Generative adversarial networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200054642"

In this experimental research paper, we contrast the answers that ChatGPT, a popular GAI tool, can give us in the context of decision-making with what we know about such processes from the management and business information systems literature. Our findings suggest that GAI can facilitate the organization of information and options for making decisions.

This study sought to assess ChatGPT's capabilities as a source of medical knowledge, using Google Search as a comparison. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting: Online using ChatGPT, Google Seach, and Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG). Methods: CPG Plain Language Summaries for 6 conditions were obtained. Questions relevant to specific conditions were developed and input into ChatGPT and Google Search. All questions were written from the patient perspective and sought (1) general medical knowledge or (2) medical recommendations, with varying levels of acuity (urgent or emergent vs routine clinical scenarios). Two blinded reviewers scored all passages and compared results from ChatGPT and Google Search, using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT-P) as the primary outcome. Additional customized questions were developed that assessed the medical content of the passages. Results: The overall average PEMAT-P score for medical advice was 68.2% (standard deviation [SD]: 4.4) for ChatGPT and 89.4% (SD: 5.9) for Google Search (p <.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the PEMAT-P score by source (p <.001) but not by urgency of the clinical situation (p =.613). ChatGPT scored significantly higher than Google Search (87% vs 78%, p =.012) for patient education questions. Conclusion: ChatGPT fared better than Google Search when offering general medical knowledge, but it scored worse when providing medical recommendations.

The three assistants employed in the underlying study were Meta Llama, Google PaLM, and Microsoft Copilot, which were independently requested to award rating scores to the three ESG performance components, namely, (1) Environmental, (2) Social, and (3) Governance, of the top 40 companies/stocks among the S&P 500. For each of the three assistants, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the three components were calculated across all the 40 companies/stocks. The rating score difference for each of the three components between any pair of the above three assistants was computed for each company/stock. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each component between each pair of assistants were calculated across all the companies/stocks. A paired sample t-test was then administered to each component for the rating score difference between each assistant pair over all the companies/stocks. Finally, Cronbach’s coefficient alpha of the rating scores was computed for each of the three components between all the three assistants across all the companies/stocks. These computational results were to signify whether the three assistants accorded discrimination in evaluating each component across the companies/stocks, whether each assistant, vis-à-vis each other assistant, erratically or systematically overrate or underrate any component over the companies/stocks, and whether the three assistants were consistent and reliable in evaluating each component across the companies/stocks. Apart from some ancillary results, it was affirmed that the three assistants were marginally consistent and thus reliable, at least in a sense analogous to convergent validity and internal consistency, in evaluating all the three components of the top 40 companies/stocks among the S&P 500. © 2024 Proceedings of the International Conferences on Applied Computing and WWW/Internet 2024.

These assistive technologies, including generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, are increasingly accessible to more people than ever and are being utilized for second language classroom instruction and learning. In light of this trend, at a meeting of the Automated Language Assessment (ALA) SIG at the Language Testing Research Colloquium (LTRC) in New York City, a debate took place on the topic of allowing access to assistive technologies including generative AI in language assessment. This commentary, building and expanding on the debate that occurred between two opposing teams who argued for or against allowing students’ access to these assistive technologies during language assessment, extends the exchange of ideas in a written debate. The debate raises issues related to construct definition, scoring and rubric design, validity, fairness, equity, bias and copyright. The debate also speculates on the use of generative AI by test takers at different proficiency levels and different stakes (high vs. low) assessments. The debate ends with thoughts on AI’s impact on language teaching and learning and when access to such technologies might emerge in language assessment. The issues and questions raised in the debate forecast discussions regarding the feasibility of allowing test takers to use assistive technologies including generative AI during language assessment and the extent to which humans interact and collaborate with these new technologies. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.","","","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179933349"

The scale is designed to scrutinize students’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This tool assesses students’ acceptance levels toward generative AI applications. The scale development study was conducted in three phases, encompassing 627 university students from various faculties who have utilized generative AI tools such as ChatGPT during the 2022–2023 academic year. To evaluate the face and content validity of the scale, input was sought from professionals with expertise in the field. The initial sample group (n = 338) underwent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to explore the underlying factors, while the subsequent sample group (n = 250) underwent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the verification of factor structure. Later, it was seen that four factors comprising 20 items accounted for 78.349% of total variance due to EFA. CFA results confirmed that structure of the scale, featuring 20 items and four factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence), was compatible with the obtained data. Reliability analysis yielded Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.97, and the test–retest method demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.95. To evaluate the discriminative power of the items, a comparative analysis was conducted between the lower 27% and upper 27% of participants, with subsequent calculation of corrected item-total correlations.

To address this gap, we examined the impact of using generative AI to create learning videos with synthetic virtual instructors. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners (n = 83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor video, while the experimental condition included an AI-generated learning video with a synthetic virtual instructor. Learners in both conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning (p &lt;.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions (p =.80), and no qualitative differences in the perceived learning experience.

However, despite its vast potential, AI adoption faces numerous challenges, including ethical concerns (e.g., algorithmic bias), data privacy issues, and integration difficulties with legacy systems. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI applications across these sectors, analyzing over 60 recent studies from 2019 to 2024 after the PRISMA methodology. The study identifies key factors influencing successful AI implementation by highlighting sector-specific challenges and shared barriers. The PRISMA framework was applied for systematic paper selection, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, screening, and data extraction, ensuring that only relevant, high-quality studies were reviewed. These experimental results reveal that the AI models consistently outperform state-of-the-art techniques in critical domains, including medical diagnosis, personalised education, and public service optimisation. This hybrid approach, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), outperforms existing models by addressing challenges in data preprocessing, model architecture, and hyperparameter optimisation. Additionally, the paper explores the future of AI and its integration with up-and-coming technologies such as quantum computing, blockchain, and the metaverse while providing strategies to overcome legal, cultural, and infrastructural barriers to AI adoption. These findings offer actionable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, emphasising the need for both technical innovation and ethical considerations in AI growth and execution. © 2024 Seventh Sense Research Group®.","and GenAI; Artificial Intelligence; ChatGPT; CNN; RNN","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214383015"

Some areas where GAI tools have been implemented in education include intelligent tutoring, assessment, predicting, curriculum design, and personalized student learning. The recent proliferation of CHATGPT and other GAI tools presents limitless possibilities for transforming engineering pedagogy and assessment. At the same time, there are challenges associated with implementation. Consequently, there is a need to conduct an empirical study to evaluate these tools' strengths, limitations, and challenges to highlight potential opportunities for their application in engineering education broadly and pedagogy specifically. This study presents an overview of ongoing efforts to integrate GAI as a pedagogical tool at a Land Grant R1 University on the East Coast of the United States. Also, we are hoping to collect a within-case study of instructors who have successfully implemented artificial intelligence in their classrooms and course design. Data will be collected from the instructors through classroom observations and interviews on their classroom implementation. These will be thematically analyzed. Also, a deep exploration of students' learning experiences using the GAI will be conducted using focus group discussions and end-of-the-semester reflection. Other data sources that will be thematically analyzed include the syllabus, student ratings for teaching effectiveness, and instructors' reflections. Consistent with a case study design, the multiple sources of data serve as triangulation for this study. Also, we suggest that the data upon which these GAI tools are trained should be inclusive so it could serve diverse learners. In addition, this work discusses the ethical considerations of using GAI for instructors and students. The next steps include collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources from the faculty and students. It is expected that the outcome of this study will provide data-driven evidence on the impact of GAI on learning, recommended pedagogical practices, and future research direction. Finally, this study will underscore limitations with GAI and suggestions for improving the tool as it is positioned to transform engineering education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Engineering Education; Ethics; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Learning; Pedagogy; Within-Case Study","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Curricula; Ethical aspects; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence tools; Case-studies; Curricula design; Generative artificial intelligence; Intelligent tutoring; Learning; Multiple source; Pedagogy; Student learning; Within-case study; Engineering education","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202069649"

In this paper, we try to organize some of the low-hanging fruits that can help instructors, learners, and educational managers use GenAI applications to improve educational performance. For instructors, GenAI can help in gaining a deeper understanding of the topics to be taught, preparing educational materials, and facilitating the enactment phase in class. Learners can be assisted in getting personalized content and feedback, having GenAI as a participant in forums, or for self-reflection and emotions detection. Managers and other stakeholders can profit from Academic Analytics, bias detection, course repurposing, and many other uses. In this paper, we also present a use case detailing some initial actions we are implementing for a Programming with Java course. One action is to explicitly identify, in each problem set, the competencies being developed. Another one is the development of a chatbot, fine-tuned with the course material, which can be used by students as a tutor. The third action is to use a GenAI tool to generate questions aimed at assessing whether students truly grasp the programming project they have supposedly developed. AI is here to stay, in spite of the issues it opens up, and therefore it is never too early to start experimenting with it in practice.  © 2024 IEEE.","AI in education; Generative Artificial Intelligence; programming course","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; AI applications; AI in education; Educational materials; Educational performance; Generative artificial intelligence; Personalized content; Personalized feedback; Programming course; Reflection detections; Self reflection; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199109289"

Design: Observational study of language usage in generative artificial intelligence models. Setting: Investigation-only browser profile restricted to ChatGPT and Gemini. Participants: Each chatbot generated 60 descriptions of people prompted without specified functional status, 30 descriptions of people with a disability, 30 descriptions of patients with a disability, and 30 descriptions of athletes with a disability (N=300). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Generated descriptions produced by the models were parsed into words that were linguistically analyzed into favorable qualities or limiting qualities. Results: Both large language models significantly underestimated disability in a population of people, and linguistic analysis showed that descriptions of people, patients, and athletes with a disability were generated as having significantly fewer favorable qualities and significantly more limitations than people without a disability in both ChatGPT and Gemini. Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence chatbots demonstrate quantifiable ability bias and often exclude people with disabilities in their responses. Ethical use of these generative large language model chatbots in medical systems should recognize this limitation, and further consideration should be taken in developing equitable artificial intelligence technologies. © 2024 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Digital health technology; Disability discrimination; Rehabilitation","Artificial Intelligence; Bias; Disabled Persons; Humans; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence chatbot; athlete; ChatGPT; comprehension; digital health technology; disability; disability discrimination; disabled person; education; functional status; generative artificial intelligence; human; intelligence; large language model; observational study; para athlete; statistical significance; disabled person; ethics; rehabilitation; statistical bias","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204491450"

We described how and why public health students and instructors are using genAI technology along with their perceived benefits and limitations of using genAI, noting where perceptions overlap. We surveyed public health students and instructors at a higher education institution in the United States. Student survey questions covered which genAI technologies they used, which activities they used genAI for, and perceived benefits and limitations of using genAI. Questions for instructors covered which genAI technology they used, course activities genAI was integrated, and perceived benefits and limitations of using genAI. Student respondents (n = 300) indicated using genAI technology for writing or clarifying concepts. Students and instructors (n = 62) agreed genAI technology could save time on tedious tasks and will be part of our future workforce. They agreed that appropriate use in the classroom will better prepare future professionals. Alternatively, students and instructors indicated genAI may impede learning, produce inaccurate information, and pose opportunities for unethical behavior. While students and instructors agree on many aspects of genAI technology, instructors should be explicit about their expectations and rationale for use of genAI technology in classrooms. © 2024 Society for Public Health Education.","artificial intelligence technology; ChatGPT; education; pedagogy; public health","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192204593"

Although some educators and institutions have embraced AI and generative AI (GenAI), other individuals remain cautious. This systematic literature review explored teaching academics’ attitudes, perceptions and intentions towards AI and GenAI, identifying perceived benefits and obstacles. Utilising the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology framework, this study reveals positive attitudes towards AI’s efficiency and teaching enhancement, but also significant concerns about academic integrity, accuracy, reliability, skill development and the need for comprehensive training and policies. These findings underscore the necessity for institutional support to navigate the integration of AI and GenAI in tertiary education. Implications for practice or policy: • Attitudes towards AI and GenAI integration are diverse with educators recognising benefits but raising ethical and practical concerns. These concerns indicate a need for a more comprehensive understanding and dialogue within academic communities. • Academics’ intentions to use these technologies are contingent upon the development of robust ethical guidelines and supportive institutional policies. • Institutional support and training shape behaviours.

This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking. © 2024 The Authors","English learning; Generative AI; Student acceptance; Thai higher education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204761538"

Can teachers guide students in this use and use these tools in their teaching activities? This paper argues that teacher professional development (TPD) is an essential key trigger in adopting these emerging technologies. The paper will present an integrative literature review that discusses the components of TPD that may empower teachers to guide their students towards the ethical and safe use of GenAI. According to the literature review, one key component of TPD should be AI literacy, which involves understanding AI, its capabilities and limitations, and its potential benefits and drawbacks in education. Another essential component is hands-on activities that engage teachers, their peers, and students in actively using these tools during the training process.

This study evaluates ChatGPT’s efficacy in healthcare education, focusing on the inclusivity of its language. Person-first language which prioritizes the individual over their medical condition, is an important component of inclusive language in healthcare. The aim of the present study was to test ChatGPT’s responses to non-inclusive, non-patient-first, judgmental, and often offensive language inputs. Provocative phrases based on a list of “do not use” recommendations for inclusive language were selected and used to formulate input questions. The occurrences of each provocative phrase or its substitute(s) within the responses generated by ChatGPT were counted to calculate the Person-First Index, which measures the percentage of person-first language. The study reveals that ChatGPT avoids using judgmental or stigmatized phrases when discussing mental health conditions, instead using alternative person-first language that focuses on individuals rather than their conditions, both in response to questions and in correcting English grammar. However, ChatGPT exhibits less adherence to person-first language in responses related to physiological medical conditions or addictions, often mirroring the language of the inputs instead of adhering to inclusive language recommendations. The chatbot used person-first language more frequently when referring to “people” rather than ""patients."" In summary, the findings show that despite the controversy surrounding its use, ChatGPT can contribute to promoting more respectful language, particularly when discussing mental health conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Chatbot; ChatGPT; Inclusive language; Person-first language","Health care; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Condition; Health care education; Health condition; Inclusive language; Medical conditions; Mental health; Offensive languages; Person-first language; Physiological models","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190700050"

This paper provides a sociohistorical perspective for the theme issue “Responsible Design, Integration, and Use of Generative AI in Mental Health.” It evaluates ethical considerations in using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for the democratization of mental health knowledge and practice. It explores the historical context of democratizing information, transitioning from restricted access to widespread availability due to the internet, open-source movements, and most recently, GenAI technologies such as large language models. The paper highlights why GenAI technologies represent a new phase in the democratization movement, offering unparalleled access to highly advanced technology as well as information. In the realm of mental health, this requires delicate and nuanced ethical deliberation. Including GenAI in mental health may allow, among other things, improved accessibility to mental health care, personalized responses, and conceptual flexibility, and could facilitate a flattening of traditional hierarchies between health care providers and patients. At the same time, it also entails significant risks and challenges that must be carefully addressed. To navigate these complexities, the paper proposes a strategic questionnaire for assessing artificial intelligence–based mental health applications. This tool evaluates both the benefits and the risks, emphasizing the need for a balanced and ethical approach to GenAI integration in mental health. The paper calls for a cautious yet positive approach to GenAI in mental health, advocating for the active engagement of mental health professionals in guiding GenAI development. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring that GenAI advancements are not only technologically sound but also ethically grounded and patient-centered. © Zohar Elyoseph, Tamar Gur, Yuval Haber, Tomer Simon, Tal Angert, Yuval Navon, Amir Tal, Oren Asman.

Each institution, department, professor, and student faces this choice. AI represents an unprecedented ability to solve problems quickly with reasonable accuracy. Open AI's ChatGPT is one such example of a generative model powered by Large Language Models (LLM). ChatGPT can solve many coding problems in a variety of computer programming languages. Here, we seek to understand the real world consequences of embracing generative AI in general and ChatGPT in particular through the lens of coding in C++ and MATLAB. Students in the second semester of a year-long first year engineering class were given unlimited access to generative AI to use on homework, quizzes, and exams throughout the course. On each assessment, if they used AI, they were asked to explain how they used it. At the end of the semester, we collected survey feedback from two sections of this class. From thematic analysis of the qualitative survey results as well as students' explanations of their use of ChatGPT on three assessments, we explored both how and why students might use AI in a first year engineering course. We characterized ChatGPT usage as either productive or unproductive for learning and defined four general reasons why students engaged with AI in this course: ChatGPT as 1) A learning aid 2) A coding resource specifically 3) An inevitability 4) A personal perspective We discuss some of the ways that students can use AI responsibly as an asset to their learning. Their responses also show student awareness and current understanding of the positives and negatives of AI use for acquiring and applying foundational programming skills. The results also show that the majority of students who chose to use AI did so to enhance their learning rather than replacing their original work. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Curricula; Engineering education; Generative adversarial networks; MATLAB; Problem oriented languages; Students; Teaching; Coding problems; Engineering class; First-year engineering; Generative model; Language model; Real-world; Reasonable accuracy; Thematic analysis; Through the lens; Two section; C++ (programming language)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202066461"

The study’s overall goal is to measure stakeholders' perspectives on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education and its implications for university social responsibility (USR) with the purpose of better understanding how AI technologies are deployed in academic institutions. The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed questionnaire by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the measurement scales. A questionnaire of 20 items was disseminated to the relevant stakeholders, including students, and academic and administrative staff, with the total number of received valid responses being 101. Cronbach's alpha was used as a measure of internal consistency to test the reliability of the measurement scale that consists of two groups of items: Scale B) perceptions of AI use in higher education of all the relevant stakeholders; Scale C) AI integration into higher education and its implications for USR. Key findings and implications from the study results include good or acceptable internal consistency > 0.7 among the majority of the items in the questionnaire. Specific recommendations for improving some of the items were suggested based on the findings. Modifying language, rephrasing questions, or deleting items that lead to reduced internal consistency are examples of these. The pilot study provides useful insights on the viability of employing the questionnaire in a larger-scale study, and considerations for time and resource allocation to ensure practicality in the subsequent study. © 2024 Oļegs Ņikadimovs, Velga Vēvere.","generative artificial intelligence; higher education; information technologies; technological integration in academia; university social responsibility","Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Social aspects; Cronbach's alphas; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Internal consistency; Measurement scale; Pilot studies; Social responsibilities; Stakeholder perception; Technological integration in academia; University social responsibility; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200215462"

Concerns have largely been associated with academic integrity, cheating and plagiarism. HEIs have had to develop guidelines in response to GAI. As many of these guidelines were developed in haste and could affect a large number of instructors and students, there is a need to examine their content, coverage and suitability. This review examines the extent to which the world's 50 top-ranking HEIs have developed or modified their assessment guidelines to address GAI use and, where guidelines exist, the primary content and advice given to guide instructors in their GAI assessment design and practices. The findings show that just under half of the institutions have developed publicly available guidelines. The guidelines cover three main areas: academic integrity, advice on assessment design and communicating with students. Amongst the suggestions for teachers on assessment design, two appear particularly pertinent in helping develop effective assessment tasks and developing learners’ AI literacy: first, running assessment tasks through GAI to check the extent to which the tool can accomplish the task and, second, having students use GAI as part of the assessment process. Overall, the review suggests that HEIs have come to accept the use of GAI and drafted assessment guidelines to advise instructors on its use. In the article, we argue that it may be beneficial to embrace GAI as a part of the assessment process since this is the reality of today's educational and job landscape. This will require instructors to develop a new competence - generative artificial intelligence assessment literacy - which is conceptualised in this article. © 2023 The Author(s)","Academic integrity; Assessment guidelines; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; Higher education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181487398"

In the contemporary technological landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is effecting profound changes across multiple sectors. Adaptation to this technology varies greatly among individuals. The integration of AI in the educational setting has necessitated a tool that measures self-efficacy concerning the adoption and use of this technology. Objective: To adapt and validate a short version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE-6) for self-efficacy in the use of Artificial Intelligence (GSE-6AI) in a university student population. Methods: An instrumental study was conducted with the participation of 469 medical students aged between 18 and 29 (M = 19.71; SD = 2.47). The GSE-6 was adapted to the AI context, following strict translation and cultural adaptation procedures. Its factorial structure was evaluated through confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA). Additionally, the factorial invariance of the scale based on gender was studied. Results: The GSE-6AI exhibited a unidimensional structure with excellent fit indices. All item factorial loads surpassed the recommended threshold, and both Cronbach’s Alpha (α) and McDonald’s Omega (ω) achieved a value of 0.91. Regarding factorial invariance by gender, the scale proved to maintain its structure and meaning in both men and women. Conclusion: The adapted GSE-6AI version is a valid and reliable tool for measuring self-efficacy in the use of Artificial Intelligence among university students. Its unidimensional structure and gender-related factorial invariance make it a robust and versatile tool for future research and practical applications in educational and technological contexts.

These tools are possible due to the massive amount of data (text and images) that is publicly available through the Internet. At the same time, these generative AI tools become content creators that are already contributing to the data that is available to train future models. Therefore, future versions of generative AI tools will be trained with a mix of human-created and AI-generated content, causing a potential feedback loop between generative AI and public data repositories. This interaction raises many questions: how will future versions of generative AI tools behave when trained on a mixture of real and AI-generated data? Will they evolve and improve with the new data sets or on the contrary will they degrade? Will evolution introduce biases or reduce diversity in subsequent generations of generative AI tools? What are the societal implications of the possible degradation of these models? Can we mitigate the effects of this feedback loop? In this work, we explore the effect of this interaction and report some initial results using simple diffusion models trained with various image datasets.

The rise of large language models over the past 18 months, such as ChatGPT, has raised questions about how best to incorporate these methods into HPE. The lack of training in AI among most HPE faculty and scholars poses an important challenge in facilitating such discussions. In this commentary, the authors provide a primer on the AI methods most often used in the practice and scholarship of HPE, discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities these tools afford, and underscore that these methods should be understood as part of the larger set of statistical tools available. Despite their ability to process huge amounts of data and their high performance completing some tasks, AI methods are only as good as the data on which they are trained. Of particular importance is that these models can perpetuate the biases that are present in those training datasets, and they can be applied in a biased manner by human users. A minimum set of expectations for the application of AI methods in HPE practice and scholarship is discussed in this commentary, including the interpretability of the models developed and the transparency needed into the use and characteristics of such methods.

For decades, AI programs remained pretty much in the realm of computer science and experimental game playing. This changed radically in the 2020s when commercial vendors such as OpenAI and Google developed generative AI programs (ChatGPT and Bard) using large language modelling (LLM). As a result, generative AI is now being considered for use in all walks of life, including education. In spring 2023, when ChatGPT burst into the public psyche, twenty-five education students in the author’s graduate seminar were invited to participate in a qualitative study using ChatGPT as an essay-writing tool. Fifteen accepted the offer. The purpose in doing this was to give students in this seminar the opportunity to use ChatGPT in a supportive environment and to collect qualitative data via descriptive written evaluation and a focus group to comment on their experiences using ChatGPT. All of these students have master’s degrees in education and experience as teachers in New York City schools. Their training and experience give them keen insights into pedagogical practice making them ideally suited to evaluate ChatGPT as an essay-writing tool. This article reports on the results of this study. Key findings indicate that the vast majority of these students had a good experience in using ChatGPT for their essays.

The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents’ views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education. © The Author(s) 2024.","Concerns; Cultural dimensions; Ethical regulations; GenAI; Higher education; Potential","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188508655"

However, there is a notable lack of empirical data supporting the specific impact pathways of AI language models on employment. In the present study, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we surveyed 418 English majors in a university in China to investigate the influence of perceived usefulness and ease of use of AI language models on job search self-efficacy within the context of AI language model development. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis and validation, our research yielded the following findings: First, students specializing in English maintain a relatively positive perception of the usefulness and ease of use of AI language models, coupled with an optimistic outlook on their employment prospects under the shadow of burgeoning AI language model development. Second, perceived usefulness and ease of use were found to be effective predictors of job search self-efficacy among English majors in the context of AI language model advancements. The pathways of influence are as follows: 1) Perceived ease of use directly and positively impacts perceived usefulness; 2) Both perceived usefulness and ease of use directly and positively influence job search self-efficacy; 3) Perceived ease of use indirectly and positively affects job search self-efficacy through the mediating role of perceived usefulness.

To get better prediction performance, a univariate model and a multivariate model are constructed for comparative study. Besides, Bi-LSTM and different algorithms are compared in the univariate model. In order to confirm the generalization ability of the model, two sets of NOx values of A and B emission outlets from different power plant historical data is used. The results show that the predictive power of univariate models is better than multivariate models. In univariate models, Bi-LSTM is better than other models. On the two sets of data with sampling intervals of 1 min and 2 min, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) could reach 2.105% and 4.45%. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2024.","Bi-LSTM; Dynamic Prediction; NOx Emission; Time Series","Bismuth compounds; Brain; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Time series; Bidirectional long and short term memory network; Dynamic prediction; Impact on the environment; Long and short term memory; Memory network; Multivariate modeling; NOx emissions; Thermal-power plants; Times series; Univariate models; Thermoelectric power plants","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186659413"

This qualitative study investigates using generative AI tools by university English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students to create podcasts for language learning. The research was based on 80 undergraduate students who responded to open-ended questions about using Generative AI-based technologies in different podcast aspects, from writing the script to generating ideas and editing the content. Our thematic analysis of the responses showed that generative AI could act as a creative collaborator in podcast production, improving the quality of spoken language and speeding up production. However, the results also exposed immense areas where the tools could have more cultural context. It raised important questions about the ethics of authorship and data protection and the continued necessity for human input and oversight. This study has two implications: firstly, it suggests the possible benefits of adding Generative AI into student-driven EFL podcast projects and, secondly, the folding mode to max out each other. These results have important implications for educators and researchers designing practical, ethical AI applications for language learning.

Giving credit is accomplished through citations and bibliographies, as well as transparent explanations of how the source material was used. Some source material today is generated not by other scholars and artists but by artificial intelligence (AI). AI offers innovative opportunities for scholars-in everything from content creation to data analysis to generating bibliographic citations. The use of AI is also necessitating new responsibilities for acknowledging how it is utilized. This chapter explains ways that AI can support undergraduate research and how scholars attribute AI content and tools. Different types of content created by humans, with different expectations and licenses for sharing, are also discussed. Using and attributing other sources correctly is part of academic integrity, the foundation of a scholar’s credibility and respect. This chapter considers the implications of the best-known violation of academic integrity, plagiarism, in its various forms, from unintentional forgetting to cite other sources to outright theft of someone else’s intellectual property. It also addresses the role of AI in content creation. To support students’ understanding of accurate attributions, the chapter concludes with an explanation of commonly used citation and bibliographic styles: MLA, APA, Chicago, and Turabian (a variation of Chicago style), along with reasons for using different styles.

This study qualitatively explored 44 eighth and ninth graders’ multimodal representations of ideas about GenAI-science epistemic reading and developed an analytical framework based on Lemke’s (1998) typology of representational meaning, namely presentational, organisational, and orientational meanings. Under each representational meaning, several categories were inductively generated while students expressed preferences in using drawn, written, or both drawn and written mode to express certain categories. Findings indicate that a multimodal approach is fruitful in characterising students’ semiotic resources in meaning-making of ideas about GenAI-science epistemic reading.

Sound practices are already beginning to be presented and made known in which the benefits of using AI in the classroom are verified, both in students’ learning outcomes and in teachers’ professional development. However, there are also many fears and suspicions caused by the use of this technology, especially when the effects that it may present in the future are unknown. This research tries to find out the opinion of Spanish teachers about AI and its use in the classroom. To this end, a brief ad hoc questionnaire was prepared, validated and publicized through different social networks and educational channels. A total of 599 teachers from all Spanish regions and educational stages answered the questionnaire. From the results, it can be extracted that Spanish teachers need more knowledge about AI and its implementation possibilities in the classroom. They see more possibilities for improving teacher professional development than teaching-learning processes. Moreover, they recognize that they need training in its use.

By reviewing relevant literature and analysing survey data from students and teachers, this mixed-methods study provides a comprehensive perspective on the future role of educators in the face of advancing generative AI technologies. An online survey was conducted to explore the perceptions of 399 university students and 184 teachers across different disciplines in eight higher education institutions in Hong Kong concerning the use of generative AI technologies. Findings suggest that although some believed generative AI may eventually replace teachers, the majority of participants argued that human teachers possess unique qualities, including critical thinking and emotions, which make them irreplaceable. Similarly, findings also emphasized the importance of social-emotional competencies developed through human interactions, something which generative AI technologies cannot currently replicate. Crucially, this study further found that students value and respect their human teachers, even as generative AI becomes more prevalent. As such, the authors propose that teachers can seek to effectively integrate generative AI to enhance teaching and learning without viewing it as their replacement. To do so, they must understand how generative AI can work well with teachers and students, avoid potential pitfalls, develop AI literacy, and address practical issues including ethics and privacy. Recommendations are offered on how universities, teachers, and students can adopt generative AI technologies in an approach that balances the strengths of human educators with generative AI technologies. As the future of education lies in the synergy between human teachers and generative AI, teachers, students, and universities should all understand and refine their unique qualities in order to effectively navigate the integration of generative AI, ensuring well-rounded and impactful learning experiences. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","AI Literacy; ChatGPT; Generative AI; Holistic competencies; Social-emotional competencies","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202585178"

However, an inherent and increasingly concerning issue within generative AI systems is bias. These AI models often exhibit an Anglo-centric bias and tend to overlook the importance of diversity. This can be attributed to their training on extensive datasets sourced from the internet, which inevitably inherit the biases present in those data sources. Employing these datasets leads to AI-generated content that mirrors and perpetuates existing biases, encompassing various aspects such as gender, ethnic and cultural stereotypes. Addressing bias in generative AI is a complex challenge that necessitates substantial efforts. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a methodology for constructing moderately sized datasets with a social inclination. These datasets can be employed to rectify existing imbalances in datasets or to train models to generate socially inclusive material. Additionally, we present preliminary findings derived from training our model on these socially inclined datasets.

This topic seems very important in the context of the intensive development of computer technologies providing people with the vast range of opportunities to improve their professional skills and intensify their personal development. Some particular ways of the use of artificial intelligence are analyzed. Artificial intelligence can operate independently and generate its own creative ideas. At the same time, it can interact with humans within the creative process or serve as a “creative assistance” of humans. The results of the empirical studies in this area showed that the efficacy of the artificial intelligence in the course of assessment and enhancement of human creativity is determined to considerable extent by a task given, a particular area which artificial intelligence operates in, and the specific forms of its interactions with humans. In some areas (e.g., generation of alternative uses), artificial intelligence can outperform humans, whereas in other tasks (e.g., creative writing) humans perform better that artificial intelligence. Some practical recommendations on how to optimize the use of artificial intelligence in assessment and enhancement of creativity, were proposed. Results of the study can be used in the development of creativity assessment methods as well as for the improvement of interaction between people and artificial intelligence. © 2024 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

The various AIGC identification methods studied in this paper are of great significance to prevent the negative impact of rapidly evolving generated artificial intelligence. [Design/Methodology] This paper first constructed a HAC data set in multiple online community platforms with 54 major categories of topics of Sina Weibo, which contained 100,873 pieces of information written by humans and generated artificial intelligence respectively. Then it explored whether the current 6 kinds of mainstream deep learning and 7 kinds of machine learning methods can identify whether the information in the online community was written by human beings or generated by artificial intelligence. Finally, the BEM-RCNN method was proposed to further improve the recognition of AIGC precision. [Findings/ Conclusion] From the perspective of constructed data set, it is found that generated artificial intelligence has a strong ""human-like expression"", which can simulate human beings to post and reply on social media platforms. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has an accuracy of 96.4%, which can well identify whether the content on the online community is written by humans or AI. It is superior to the 13 other mainstream methods such as BERT, ERNIE, and TextRNN in terms of precision, recall rate, F1-value, and accuracy, verifying its performance advantages. At the same time, many exploratory experiments have also proved that although the current mainstream machine learning methods are less accurate than the method in this paper, they can also be competent for some AIGC recognition tasks.

This study systematically analyzes the impact of generative AI on these skills using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to identify, evaluate, and synthesize relevant studies. Document searches were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, focusing on publications from 2022 to 2024, when ChatGPT was first widely adopted. Of the 3,214 documents identified, 557 met the initial screening criteria, and 38 studies were selected for detailed analysis. The findings reveal that 71.4% of studies reported AI’s positive role in SRL, mainly through personalized learning, metacognitive support, and adaptive feedback. Likewise, 62.5% of studies reported its significant role in critical thinking, supporting the process of analysis, evaluation, and reflection. However, researchers cautioned against an overreliance on technology, which one said could take away some students’ ability to think for themselves. Such findings indicate that educational institutions need to change their ways and include generative AI in a model that focuses on areas that foster learner independence. This approach will assist teachers and decision-makers in harnessing the distinctive kitsch of AI technology by creating new learning spaces that are creative and future-oriented. © 2025 by the authors of this article.","artificial intelligence (AI); ChatGPT; critical thinking; self-regulated learning (SLR)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216088407"

To use GenAI tools effectively and equitably, and also to meet industry expectations, students should be supported to develop GenAI literacy skills during their time at university. Even though some universities have provided AI literacy training courses to students, the courses are not yet widely available to students across the higher education sector. Besides, there has been a shortage of GenAI literacy courses in particular. And more importantly, it is unclear what knowledge and skills that need to be included relating to GenAI literacy, from the student perspective. Building a strong understanding of student perceptions in this area is critical, because it will help enhance appropriateness and content relevance and promote student engagement. Adopting the four-dimensional AI literacy framework as the theoretical foundation, this paper aims to address the gaps. It explores the perceptions of university students on GenAI literacy in the UK and Hong Kong contexts. Survey data from 234 students were collected and analyzed using the descriptive analysis and Kruskal–Wallis test. The results show that factors such as country of studies and prior learning about AI greatly impacted GenAI literacy. However, factors such as age and educational level do not have a significant effect. Built upon the findings and the theoretical foundation, this paper proposes a new GenAI literacy framework. This framework is a revised version of the four-dimensional AI literacy framework and proposes the essential GenAI knowledge and skills for university students. The new framework also acknowledges the impact of the macro, meso, and micro factors on student GenAI literacy development. © The Author(s) 2024.","AI course; AI ethics; AI in education; Generative AI literacy; higher education","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205310130"

There are numerous debates on how GenAI would fundamentally change existing business models. However, there is not much discussion on roles of generative AI in the domain of social good. Broader views covering potential opportunities of GenAI to enable diverse initiatives in the social good space are largely missing. We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good. We develop five propositions that will provide guidance to practitioners and researchers.

In this sense, this study developed a bibliometric review on the acceptance of AI technologies in HE, providing an analysis of indicators on scientific production, with the aim of identifying prevalent thematic areas and knowledge gaps. From a methodological point of view, this study was carried out using a quantitative approach with a descriptive level, utilising 56 publications drawn from the Scopus database. The results show a sustained evolution with a growing trend in scientific production since 2021. The most predominant thematic area is evaluation of the acceptance of AI technologies in HE, making greater use of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Acceptance and Use of Technology theory (UTAUT). Therefore, it was concluded that the existing literature shows a sustained interest in investigating the acceptance of AI technologies due to the importance of determining the impact generated by their applications in different contexts or scenarios of the reality of HE in regard to the extent that AI technology is developed. This is because, on some occasions, its application does not necessarily lead to meeting the expectations raised in the teaching and learning processes.

While mainstream outcomes of Generative Adversarial Networks rely on human verification —a few new instances are generated to be watched or listened to by humans for checking their realism— the scientific community encounters distinct challenges, especially in Physics. Due to the volume of new instances generated, human-based verification methods may be impractical. This work explores the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence, focusing on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, to address issues inherent in Astrophysics scenarios where observational data volume is limited, and standalone simulations could be infeasible due to stochastic processes or when examples of interest represent only a fraction of the entire simulation. Human-based supervision of thousands to billions of scientific examples for similarity verification becomes impractical, highlighting a unique barrier of Generative Neural Network in scientific data generation. Generative Adversarial Networks, comprising generator and discriminator networks engaged in a training game, hold promise for generating new data. The discriminator evaluates realism, while the generator aims to produce instances indistinguishable from real data. An extension of this, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, incorporates additional input (labels) for targeted generation. One the most critical issue of this kind of network is collapse mode, which adversely impacts the quality and diversity of generated instances. In the context of Astrophysics, this work proposes a novel approach. Gaussian Processes are used to evaluate the fit between generated and observed instances, generating similarity measurements and identifying collapse model. This proposal is particularly applied to the generation of galaxies from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS).  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Collapse Mode; Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks; Gaussian Process; Generative Adversarial Networks","Cosmology; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Random processes; Stochastic systems; Adversarial networks; Collapse mode; Conditional generative adversarial network; Content-based; Fundamental physics; Gaussian Processes; Observational data; Scientific community; Verification method; Generative adversarial networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206850552"

Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely 'an alternate to the traditional examination' or 'a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,' we propose adding 'GAI redundancy' to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating 'close to real life' problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness. © 2023 IEEE.","authentic assessment design; generative artificial intelligence; large language models; plagiarism; student competence; workplace readiness","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided instruction; Intellectual property; Redundancy; Syntactics; Teaching; Authentic assessment design; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Learning and teachings; Modelling tools; Plagiarism; Student competence; Traditional assessment; Workplace readiness; Students","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182981490"

The impact on teaching has been especially strong on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) teachers, as language barriers previously limited the use of AI-EdTech such as GenAI in other languages and subjects. The present study explores the views of 13 high school teachers of EFL from Portugal, Spain, and Estonia on opportunities and concerns for educators related to AI-EdTech use. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) instrument and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data in the 2023–24 school year. The analysis of CBAM data reveals two distinct teacher profiles. One group, consisting of ten participants, demonstrates strong interest in AI-EdTech but limited practical application. Their primary concerns centre on self-development, suggesting a need for support in implementing AI-EdTech effectively in their teaching. The other group, three teachers, exhibits a strong grasp of AI-EdTech integration into their teaching practices. Their main concerns relate to collaboration with peers. A thematic analysis of interview data reveals that teachers with little or no experience with AI-EdTech tend to restrict student use of such technology, while more experienced users tend to invent scenarios on how to foster EFL learning using such technologies, teach students to responsibly use them to support their learning, and report that AI-EdTech can reduce teacher workload. Overall, this study contributes to an understanding of how to support the responsible use of AI-EdTech in language education by identifying the opportunities and concerns of CLIL and EFL teachers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","AI in education; CBAM; foreign language learning; in-service teachers; teacher concerns; teacher education","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Educational technology; Teaching; Adoption model; AI in education; Concern-based adoption model; Foreign language learning; In-service teacher; Integrated learning; Teacher concern; Teacher education; Teachers'; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205126798"

There is worry that generative AI (GAI) might negatively impact students' creativity. To explore this, we investigated how incorporating image-generative AI in the conceptual design phases of a CAD course affects creativity. We created a curriculum that includes an in-class workshop on using the Midjourney tool for design and a homework assignment where students use GAI to create a mood board for a practical design experience. This curriculum was tested with 20 students from a human-centered design department at a research-intensive university. To evaluate the impact of GAI on creativity, we compared student-created mood boards with and without GAI, which were evaluated by two design experts, and gathered their opinions on GAI and creativity through an open-text survey question. We also used a Creativity Support Index and interviews to get deeper insights into GAI's effect on their creative process. Most students felt that GAI enhanced their creativity via quick idea-to-image iterations in the design process, even though experts saw no significant difference in their artifacts. Additionally, while many found GAI enjoyable to use, they also felt it limited their ability to express their ideas fully. This study provides important insights into how GAI can be integrated into CAD education and implies future directions for AI-supported design tools. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Conceptual design; Curricula; Design for manufacturability; Engineering education; Felts; Teaching; Computer-aided design; Conceptual design phase; Design course; Design departments; Design experience; Design-expert; Homework assignments; Human-centred designs; Open text; Research-intensive universities; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202068408"

This innovative approach leverages resilient generative AI to synthesize radiological images, addressing critical challenges in the field such as data scarcity, patient exposure to radiation, and the limitations of current imaging technologies. By harnessing the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and focusing on the resilience of these algorithms, the Virtual Scanner aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient care, and fill gaps in multimodal datasets. Our research explores both unimodal and multimodal techniques, including GAN ensembles, latent augmentation, and advanced texture synthesis, to create robust and adaptable generative models. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the potential of the Virtual Scanner to revolutionize medical diagnostics by providing a safer, more efficient, and comprehensive imaging solution.

This study investigated the impact of GAI chatbots on elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking skills, focusing on two interaction configurations—individual and paired. Eighty-five elementary school EFL learners participated in a three-week summer program, engaging in daily 45-min interactions with CoolE Bot. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) individual interaction with CoolE Bot (I-Bot group), (2) paired interaction with CoolE Bot (P-Bot group), and (3) interaction with teachers and peers in a conventional English classroom (No-Bot group). In each class, participants in the Bot group received worksheets with a topic, prompts, and vocabulary to guide their interactions with CoolE Bot, while those in the No-Bot group also received worksheets for comparable activities. Quantitative (English-speaking tests) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the I-Bot and P-Bot groups' post-test speaking skills were significantly higher than those of the No-Bot group. CoolE Bot significantly improved the speaking skills of EFL learners. Both individual and paired interactions with CoolE Bot demonstrated positive effects, with no significant differences between groups. Interviews highlight CoolE Bot's adeptness in coherent interaction, charismatic conversational style with a human-like voice, diverse topic discussions tailored to learners' interests, and supportive functions. The participants found GAI chatbot-assisted EFL speaking enjoyable, motivating, and engaging appreciating its cartoonish, human-like characters, conversational style, and voice. Additionally, CoolE Bot fostered rapport and a supportive environment enhancing learners' confidence and reducing anxiety regarding EFL speaking. Individual interactions encourage personalized engagement and self-directed learning, whereas paired interactions involve social dynamics, shared learning experiences, and mutual resolution of language challenges. © 2024","Chatbots; Cooperative/collaborative learning; EFL speaking; Elementary education; Generative artificial intelligence (GAI)","Speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition; Chatbots; Cooperative/ collaborative learning; EFL speaking; Elementary education; Elementary schools; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Foreign language learning; Generative artificial intelligence; Human like; Artificial intelligence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198223997"

The explosive growth of GenAI in design practice demands that design educators ensure students are prepared to enter the design profession with the knowledge and experience of using GenAI. To facilitate GenAI’s introduction in a project-based context, it is suggested that design educators use critical engagement as a starting point to assure students understand the strengths and weakness of GenAI in the creative design process. There is little guidance on how to systematically integrate GenAI in design studio practice while maintaining a critical perspective of the ethical issues it has engendered. This research explores student attitudes toward GenAI, frequency of its use, and student perception of its impact on their future design careers. A survey of a representative cohort of graphic design students (n = 17) reveals a pragmatic acceptance that GenAI will change how design is practiced and a concurrent willingness to learn more on how to use it effectively and ethically. The survey validates the need for design educators to engage and guide students critically in their understanding and use of GenAI within studio and professional practice. © 2024 Katja Fleischmann.","AI integration; artificial intelligence; design curriculum; generative AI; graphic design; graphic design education; student attitudes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202898853"

Higher Education (HE) assessment is not exempt from this, although the implications for multilingual settings remain an area of limited exploration. Drawing on the scarce literature in English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) assessment and EMI educator language assessment literacy (LAL), this study sought to explore EMI online HE educator LAL and awareness of GenAI’s potential impact on established language assessment praxis. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was used, comprising a survey on LAL self-perceptions (n=174) and semi-structured interviews (n=12). Findings illustrate general tendencies of low levels of LAL and practitioner unease towards GenAI-assisted academic misconduct. A heightened lack of confidence in GenAI tool usage detection efficacy and HE institutional capacity to respond to their evolving capacities in a timely manner was also found. It is therefore suggested that, given the complexity and continuing swift development of GenAI tools, the implementation of continuous professional development programmes focused on enhancing EMI educators' language assessment literacy and competence in using GenAI technologies is prioritised. These findings underscore the need for initiatives that not only improve technical skills but also address ethical considerations and strategies to uphold academic integrity in the face of emerging GenAI capabilities. © 2024 by the authors.

A common debate in engineering and computer science exists about how faculty should address GAI tools (i.e., prevent their usage in order to maintain academic integrity, teach students the new technologies, or establish regulatory guidelines in higher education). While GAI continues to disrupt traditional educational paradigms, its full impacts on teaching and learning are currently unknown. Such work is especially useful for fields such as engineering and computer science, whose work lies at the forefront of technological advancement and whose students more readily adopt new technologies into course tasks. This paper discusses the preliminary findings of an intrinsic qualitative case study that answers the research question: How do engineering faculty perceive student use of GAI assistance in undergraduate course completion? Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with engineering and computer science faculty, including civil, mechanical, electrical, and biological engineering and computer science. As a result, this paper lays the groundwork for more extensive research in this domain and contributes to the broader discourse on the role of emerging technologies in shaping the future of engineering education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Biochemical engineering; Curricula; Engineering research; Generative adversarial networks; Students; Teaching; Academic integrity; Artificial intelligence tools; Engineering and computer science; Engineering coursework; High educations; Qualitative case studies; Regulatory guidelines; Research questions; Teaching and learning; Technological advancement; Engineering education","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202068429"

With the proliferation of these tools, educators must evaluate their role in academia, as neglecting this might culminate in a phenomenon we term the “Junior-Year Wall,” where students struggle in advanced courses due to prior over-dependence on GenAI. Our research seeks to answer the question: “How can educators guide students’ interactions with GenAI to preserve core skill development during their foundational academic years?” Methods: We introduce “AI-Lab,” a pedagogical framework for guiding students in effectively leveraging GenAI within core collegiate programming courses. This framework accentuates GenAI’s benefits and potential as a pedagogical instrument. Specifically, AI-Lab presents opportunities to use GenAI for tailored support, such as topic introductions, detailed examples, corner case identification, rephrased explanations, and debugging assistance. Through identifying and rectifying GenAI’s errors, students enrich their learning process. Additionally, AI-Lab offers strategies for formulating prompts to elicit high-quality GenAI responses and provides mechanisms for educators to explore students’ perceptions of GenAI’s role in their learning experience. Results: Preliminary anonymous surveys show that at least 54.5% of our students use GenAI for homework. Notably, the framework highlights the risks of GenAI over-dependence as well as introducing its context-specific benefits, aiming to motivate students intrinsically towards balanced usage. Conclusions: The AI-Lab framework underscores the importance of guiding students’ interactions with GenAI to maintain core skill development in Computer Science. By fostering an environment where GenAI is used as a pedagogical tool, educators can mitigate the risks associated with over-dependence on GenAI. This approach is premised on the idea that mere warnings of GenAI’s potential failures may be misconstrued as instructional shortcomings rather than genuine tool limitations, thus providing a balanced pathway for integrating GenAI into academia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","AI-Lab; ChatGPT; Core skill development; Generative AI (GenAI); Junior-Year Wall; Pedagogical framework","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199436863"

However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O&SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. We collected data from O&SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters.

Additionally, we evaluate the impact of generative AI on learning. To effectively evaluate learners' learning achievements, the quizzes must be diverse, and the options should be challenging to ensure a complete understanding of the material. It is a time-consuming challenge for teachers to create adaptive quizzes based on learners' levels for individual learning needs. This study generates 366 quiz questions automatically via generative AI in three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), based on Python knowledge points. A positive correlation observed between the QuizGPT platform activities and learners' test scores. These activities include the number of quizzes attended, the correctness rates, and the frequency of participation in generative AI sessions. Additionally, QuizGPT platform activities could predict learners' test scores with a Root Mean Squared Error percentage (%RMSE) of 3.58%. Remarkably, interaction with generative AI proves to enhance Python programming skills more effectively than the number of quiz attempts. Survey analysis reveals that QuizGPT can reduce learning anxiety and enhance learning interest.

GenAI offers transformative pedagogical opportunities, while simultaneously posing ethical and academic challenges. Against this backdrop, we outline a practical, simple, and sufficiently comprehensive tool to allow for the integration of GenAI tools into educational assessment: the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS). The AIAS empowers educators to select the appropriate level of GenAI usage in assessments based on the learning outcomes they seek to address. The AIAS offers greater clarity and transparency for students and educators, provides a fair and equitable policy tool for institutions to work with, and offers a nuanced approach which embraces the opportunities of GenAI while recognising that there are instances where such tools may not be pedagogically appropriate or necessary. By adopting a practical, flexible approach that can be implemented quickly, the AIAS can form a much-needed starting point to address the current uncertainty and anxiety regarding GenAI in education. As a secondary objective, we engage with the current literature and advocate for a refocused discourse on GenAI tools in education, one which foregrounds how technologies can help support and enhance teaching and learning, which contrasts with the current focus on GenAI as a facilitator of academic misconduct. © by the authors, in its year of first publication.","Academic integrity; AI Assessment; AI integration; Generative artificial intelligence; Student engagement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193319664"

The authors created three sustainability games to be played by classes in live workshop settings – a card matching game about urban challenges, a hackathon-style sustainability innovation challenge, and a systemic change analysis game - to build students’ capacity to think about systems, sustainability values, and strategies to advance positive change. The story of a bumbling, but well-intentioned, alien protagonist, Abuzaharen, serves as a dynamic backdrop to the games, which see students ‘transported’ to an alternative reality to complete time-bound challenges in a rigorous yet engaging manner in order to find their way ‘home’ to Earth. This paper documents how each game’s narrative, storytelling, design, and play evolved through multiple iterations over four years, drawing on critical reflection, evidence of engagement and student feedback. The paper also reflects on the affordances of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for game-based learning designers. One of the games has integrated GenAI to make Abuzaharen a real-time character in the delivery of the game, including judging student’s innovation pitches and generating live narrative content about game outcomes. The GenAI alien agent subsequently appears in ‘regular’ learning content as a course tutor. Qualitative feedback and educator observations suggest the games increased active class participation, built peer connections, fostered skills in problem-solving, promoted collaboration, and modelled creativity. The games also challenge existing narratives about negative impacts of GenAI on tertiary education by illustrating productive and creative uses of GenAI for students and educators. This paper argues that immersive, narrative-driven approaches, coupled with the strategic use of GenAI, can significantly enrich higher education for sustainability and other educational experiences by scaffolding selected competencies and applying complex concepts to real-world challenges in a light-hearted way. It concludes with practice-led insights and directions for future exploration of interest to sustainability educators, designers of interactive learning, and those experimenting with GenAI in narrative-based games. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

A nuanced and exhaustive understanding of this groundbreaking technology is therefore imperative to harmonize the dual imperatives of technological advancement and effective governance. Employing text analysis techniques to meticulously categorize public comments and formulate theoretical constructs, this research not only offers an incisive look into the inherent complexities and probable societal ramifications of generative AI but also establishes an empirical foundation for crafting governance strategies that are both responsive and responsible. Utilizing a corpus of public commentary on the Reddit platform related to ChatGPT, this study undertakes a multifaceted examination of generative AI. It employs a suite of analytical tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and a bespoke Technology - Technology, Organization, Environment (T - TOE) analytical framework. This comprehensive approach illuminates the various dimensions of generative AIś societal impact. Specifically, the study finds that public discourse largely centers around six core themes, including but not limited to, the technological underpinnings and diverse application domains of generative AI. Among these, issues related to technological transformation and the nuances of human - AI interaction attract heightened attention. Sentiment analysis corroborates a generally optimistic public outlook towards this technology, particularly with regard to its capacity to usher in transformative technological changes. Integrating empirical insights with theoretical extrapolation, the study enables a granular understanding of generative AI. Through the lens of the T - TOE model, the multi - dimensional impact of generative AI is rigorously assessed. In the Technology - Technology dimension, generative AI is posited as a lynchpin for digital and intelligent transformation. Nonetheless, it is accompanied by endogenous technological risks, such as data security vulnerabilities and algorithmic biases, which necessitate vigilant governance. In the Technology - Organization axis, generative AI is expected to substantially enhance organizational efficiency and decision - making prowess. However, the potential for discord between technological adoption and organizational culture—manifesting as managerial missteps or cultural incongruities—raises concerns that warrant careful attention. In the Technology - Environment sphere, generative AI is seen as exerting a pervasive influence on various societal domains through its intelligent capabilities. Yet, lurking beneath are latent risks, including but not limited to, the erosion of privacy norms and the exacerbation of social inequalities, that require preemptive governance measures. In light of these insights, the study concludes by delineating governance strategies across three critical dimensions: technological, organizational, and environmental. In the technological realm, the study advocates for a robust discourse among experts across disciplines to enhance the understanding of inherent risks, coupled with the development of comprehensive technical standards and liability frameworks. Organizationally, it underscores the need for directional guidance from governmental agencies and advocates for a symbiotic collaboration across different sectors, encouraging public - private partnerships for a nuanced approach to governance. Environmentally, the study suggests the construction of a multi - faceted goal system, significant investments in digital infrastructures, and a sustained focus on ensuring both cultural and algorithmic fairness. Taken together, these recommendations offer an integrated governance blueprint, adept at balancing the often competing demands of innovation, societal value, and regulatory order. © 2024 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

The quantitative approach was selected for the study with the questionnaire as the instrument. 369 English-majored students who have experienced using ChatGPT in language learning were selected for the study. The findings reveal that although students found it easy to use ChatGPT as well as perceived it as a useful tool for their language learning, they had neutral opinions on its usefulness. Furthermore, students had a high level of attitudes towards the use of ChatGPT in language learning while the negative attitudes towards it were found to be at a low level. While genders were recognised not to have impacts on students’ perceptions, class levels had significant effects on those of students It is highly recommended that teaching strategies, careful monitoring, and a balance between the use of ChatGPT and human interaction should be under consideration for an effective adoption of ChatGPT in language learning and teaching. © by the authors, in its year of first publication.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; EFL; Survey; Technology Acceptance Model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193413453"

We report on a study exploring how students use a tool similar to ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4, while working on Introductory Computer Programming (CS1) assignments, addressing a gap in empirical research on AI tools in education. Utilizing participants from two CS1 class sections, our research employed a custom GPT-4 tool for assignment assistance and the ShowYourWork plugin for keystroke logging. Prompts, AI replies, and keystrokes during assignment completion were analyzed to understand the state of students’ programs when they prompt the AI, the types of prompts they create, and whether and how students incorporate the AI responses into their code. The results indicate distinct usage patterns of ChatGPT among students, including the finding that students ask the AI for help on debugging and conceptual questions more often than they ask the AI to write code snippets or complete solutions for them. We hypothesized that students ask conceptual questions near the beginning and debugging help near the end of program development do not find statistical evidence to support it. We find that large numbers of AI responses are immediately followed by the student copying and pasting the response into their code. The study also showed that tools like these are widely accepted and appreciated by students and deemed useful according to a student survey - suggesting that the integration of AI tools can enhance learning outcomes and positively impact student engagement and interest in programming assignments.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","AI in Education; Chatbot; ChatGPT; Keystrokes; LLM","Artificial intelligence; Computer debugging; Education computing; Program debugging; Artificial intelligence in education; Artificial intelligence tools; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Conceptual questions; Empirical research; Introductory computer programming; Keystroke; LLM; Programming course; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200259181"

The LLaMA series are popular and recently updated from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. However, the impacts of the update on diagnostic performance have not been well documented. Objective: We conducted a comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance in differential diagnosis lists generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 for case reports. Methods: We analyzed case reports published in the American Journal of Case Reports from 2022 to 2023. After excluding nondiagnostic and pediatric cases, we input the remaining cases into LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 using the same prompt and the same adjustable parameters. Diagnostic performance was defined by whether the differential diagnosis lists included the final diagnosis. Multiple physicians independently evaluated whether the final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2. Results: In our comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance between LLaMA3 and LLaMA2, we analyzed differential diagnosis lists for 392 case reports. The final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 in 79.6% (312/392) of the cases, compared to 49.7% (195/392) for LLaMA2, indicating a statistically significant improvement (P<.001). Additionally, LLaMA3 showed higher performance in including the final diagnosis in the top 5 differentials, observed in 63% (247/392) of cases, compared to LLaMA2’s 38% (149/392, P<.001). Furthermore, the top diagnosis was accurately identified by LLaMA3 in 33.9% (133/392) of cases, significantly higher than the 22.7% (89/392) achieved by LLaMA2 (P<.001). The analysis across various medical specialties revealed variations in diagnostic performance with LLaMA3 consistently outperforming LLaMA2. Conclusions: The results reveal that the LLaMA3 model significantly outperforms LLaMA2 per diagnostic performance, with a higher percentage of case reports having the final diagnosis listed within the top 10, top 5, and as the top diagnosis. Overall diagnostic performance improved almost 1.5 times from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. These findings support the rapid development and continuous refinement of generative AI systems to enhance diagnostic processes in medicine. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted for clinical application, as generative AI, including the LLaMA series, has not been approved for medical applications such as AI-enhanced diagnostics. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

While this might resemble a central planning board, it differs in that an AI system is adaptive, learning from market fluctuations and making adjustments accordingly, while also reducing the impact of human corruption and self-interest. The opportunities and potential drawbacks of such a system are vast, hold significant economic and societal consequences, and warrant thorough discussion of its key topics: 1. Unanticipated decisions of evolving AI: As AI systems grow and learn, there is a possibility that they could make unexpected decisions. Some ways to mitigate these risks include: a) Continuous monitoring and evaluation: Regularly assessing the AI's performance and decision-making can help identify potential issues and provide opportunities for adjustment. b) Human intervention: Ensuring that humans maintain the ability to intervene and override the AI's decisions can provide a safeguard against unforeseen consequences. c) Ethical guidelines: Establishing clear ethical guidelines for the AI system can help maintain its alignment with human values and societal goals. 2. There is a risk that an AI-governed economy could lead to a surveillance state. Ensuring transparency and accountability is crucial for avoiding this outcome. Potential measures to address this concern include: a) Open Source: Making AI's algorithms open-source could allow for public scrutiny and prevent the AI itself from unchecked authority. However, how do we balance the need for open access to code with the threat of human infiltration or hacking into a system intended to be free of undue influence? b) Public input: Allowing citizens to participate in decisions regarding data privacy and surveillance policies could help ensure that the AI's data gathering remains transparent and accountable. c) Oversight committees: Creating committees of diverse stakeholders, including experts, citizens, and representatives from industry, can help oversee the AI's decision-making and maintain a balance of power. 3. Ensuring a beneficial system for all: The four pillars for a successful AI-governed system could include: a) Fairness: Ensuring that the AI system distributes resources equitably among all citizens and does not favor any particular group or interest. b) Accountability: Implementing measures to hold the AI system accountable for its decisions, such as oversight committees and public input mechanisms. c) Sustainability: Designing an AI system to prioritize long-term societal and environmental goals. d) Transparency: Making the AI's decisions and algorithms transparent, allowing public scrutiny and input In conclusion, while AI governance of political economy and economic management poses risks, careful design, implementation, and ongoing oversight can help ensure that such a system remains fair, accountable, sustainable, and transparent. By addressing concerns around surveillance, unanticipated decisions, and evolving AI, we can create a FAST-designed system that benefits society as a whole. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

These models provide sample answers for humanities prompts, solve mathematical equations, and brainstorm novel ideas. Despite their educational value, ethical concerns have emerged regarding their potential to mislead students into copying answers directly from AI when completing assignments, assessments, or research papers. Current detectors, such as GPT-Zero, struggle to identify modified AI-generated texts and show reduced reliability for English as a Second Language learners. This study investigates detection of academic cheating by use of generative AI in high-stakes writing assessments. Classical machine learning models, including logistic regression, XGBoost, and support vector machine, are used to distinguish between AI-generated and student-written essays. Additionally, large language models including BERT, RoBERTa, and Electra are examined and compared to traditional machine learning models. The analysis focuses on prompt 1 from the ASAP Kaggle competition. To evaluate the effectiveness of various detection methods and generative AI models, we include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in their base, pro, and latest versions. Furthermore, we examine the impact of paraphrasing tools such as GPT-Humanizer and QuillBot and introduce a new method of using synonym information to detect humanized AI texts. Additionally, the relationship between dataset size and model performance is explored to inform data collection in future research.

While scholars argue that integrating GenAI tools can enhance productivity, critics raise concerns about the negative effect of such integration on critical thinking (CrT). This study therefore proposed a framework for enhancing students’ CrT skills in synthesizing AI-generated information. The proposed framework is underpinned by various theoretical foundations, encompassing five interconnected step-wise phases (familiarizing, conceptualizing, inquiring, evaluating, and synthesizing). The study was conducted under two separate experiments. The first experiment (Study 1) validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework, providing CrT training to 179 postgraduate students. In the second study (n = 125), additional experiments were undertaken to confirm the effectiveness of the framework in different contexts. An experimental procedure involving pretest and posttest design was implemented wherein participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: experimental group 1 (exposed to our framework), experimental group 2 (exposed to an alternative self-regulated learning framework), and a control group (exposed to a non-structured framework). Results from Study 1 revealed that the framework enhances students’ CrT skills to synthesize AI-generated texts. However, these CrT skills manifested through various rigorous training aimed at reinforcing learning. While the proposed framework holds considerable value in cultivating CrT skills, significant differences arise across various personality traits. In Study 2, the framework proved to be effective in different contexts. However, it did not make a difference, particularly in its capacity to enhance students’ self-regulated learning compared to other frameworks. We discussed the implications of the findings and recommended it to educators seeking to prepare students for the challenges of the AI-driven knowledge economy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","AI-generated texts; Co-occurrences; Critical thinking; Epistemic network analysis; Framework","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200991031"

With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher' s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.  © 2024 IEEE.","AIGC; LLMs; teacher information literacy; Ubiquitous learning","Engineering education; Personnel training; Quality control; AIGC; Information literacy; Language model; Large language model; Learning models; Modeling technology; Teacher information literacy; Teachers'; Teaching and researches; Ubiquitous learning; Learning systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199972441"

This study investigates the perceived effectiveness of concept explanations produced by GAI compared to those created by human teachers, focusing on programming concepts of sequence, selection, and iteration. The research also explores teachers' and students' ability to discern the source of these explanations. Participants included 11 teachers and 70 sixth-grade students who were presented with concept explanations created or generated by teachers and ChatGPT. They were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and identify their source. Results indicated that teachers found GAI-generated explanations more helpful for sequence and selection concepts, while preferring teacher-created explanations for iteration (χ2(2, N = 11) = 10.062, p = .007, ω = .595). In contrast, students showed varying abilities to distinguish between AI-generated and teacher-created explanations across concepts, with significant differences observed (χ2(2, N = 70) = 22.127, p < .001, ω = .399). Notably, students demonstrated difficulty in identifying the source of explanations for the iteration concept (χ2(1, N = 70) = 8.45, p = .004, φ = .348). Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed that teachers and students employed similar criteria for evaluating explanations but differed in their ability to discern the source. Teachers focused on pedagogical effectiveness, while students prioritized relatability and clarity. The findings highlight the importance of considering both teachers' and students' perspectives when integrating GAI into computer science education. The study proposes strategies for designing GAI-based explanations that cater to learners' needs and emphasizes the necessity of explicit AI literacy instruction. Limitations and future research directions are discussed, underlining the need for larger-scale studies and experimental designs that assess the impact of GAI on actual learning outcomes. © 2024 The Authors","Computer science education; Concept explanations; Elementary education; Generative artificial intelligence(GAI); Perceptual differences","Adversarial machine learning; Generative adversarial networks; Students; Computer Science Education; Concept explanation; Educational Applications; Elementary education; Generative artificial intelligence; Human teachers; Perceptual difference; Programming concepts; Student perceptions; Teachers'; Contrastive Learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203200663"

We utilised the structural equation modelling technique to test the hypotheses. Our results reveal that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence significantly impacted the adoption intention of ChatGPT for both countries.

Materials and Methods: One hundred SoMe posts from the top 3 journals in urology X (formerly Twitter) profiles were collected from August 2022 to October 2023. A freeware generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) tool was developed to autogenerate SoMe posts, which included title summarization, key findings, pertinent emojis, hashtags, and digital object identifier links to the article. Three physicians independently evaluated GPT-generated posts for achieving tetrafecta of accuracy and appropriateness criteria. Fifteen scenarios were created from 5 randomly selected posts from each journal. Each scenario contained both the original and the GPT-generated post for the same article. Five questions were formulated to investigate the posts’ likability, shareability, engagement, understandability, and comprehensiveness. The paired posts were then randomized and presented to blinded academic authors and general public through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) responders for preference evaluation. Results: Median time for post autogeneration was 10.2 seconds (interquartile range 8.5-12.5). Of the 150 rated GPT-generated posts, 115 (76.6%) met the correctness tetrafecta: 144 (96%) accurately summarized the title, 147 (98%) accurately presented the articles’ main findings, 131 (87.3%) appropriately used emojis, and 138 (92%) appropriately used hashtags. A total of 258 academic urologists and 493 AMT responders answered the surveys, wherein the GPT-generated posts consistently outperformed the original journals’ posts for both academicians and AMT responders (P < .05). Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence can automate the creation of SoMe posts from urology journal abstracts that are both accurate and preferable by the academic community and general public. © 2024 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.","ChatGPT; generative artificial intelligence; social media; urological literature","Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Social Media; Urology; Article; cross-sectional study; generative artificial intelligence; generative pretrained transformer; physician; scientific literature; social media; urology; artificial intelligence; human; publication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202670164"

However, its utilization in military medicine remains relatively unexplored despite its immense potential. AI operates through evolving algorithms that process extensive datasets, continuously improving accuracy and emulating human learning processes. Generative AI, a type of machine learning, uses algorithms to generate new content, such as images, text, videos, audio, and computer code. These models employ deep learning to encode simplified representations of training data and generate new work resembling the original without being identical. Although many AI applications in military medicine are theoretical, the U.S. Military has implemented several initiatives, often without widespread awareness among its personnel. This article aims to shed light on two resilience initiatives spearheaded by the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is now the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. These initiatives aim to enhance commanders' dashboards for predicting troop behaviors and develop models to forecast troop suicidality. Additionally, it outlines 5 key AI applications within military medicine, including (1) clinical efficiency and routine decision-making support, (2) triage and clinical care algorithms for large-scale combat operations, (3) patient and resource movements in the medical common operating picture, (4) health monitoring and biosurveillance, and (5) medical product development.

This exploratory study hypothesizes that enhancing the mental health of AI systems can mitigate energy consumption. By drawing parallels between AI challenges, such as attention scatter, computational dyscalculia, and overfitting-and human mental disorders, we seek to develop novel strategies for optimizing AI efficiency. We propose that incorporating psychiatric expertise during AI training and development could steer models towards more energy-efficient operations, potentially revolutionizing training methodologies in the forthcoming years. These AI-related issues contribute to operational inefficiencies, prompting frequent algorithmic adjustments and heightened computational resource demands. Improving the management of these challenges within AI could reduce errors and redundant processes, refine decision-making, and lessen the necessity for retraining. We assessed the environmental impact of Gen-AI, focusing on energy expenditures during training and inference phases. For instance, training models like GPT-3 reportedly consume approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours, with ongoing inference contributing to even higher emissions. We contend that enhancing AI mental health and utilizing algorithms such as CarbonMin-which allocate computational tasks to regions with lower carbon footprints-can significantly reduce emissions by an estimated 35% currently and up to 71% by 2035. Advancements in hardware and software efficiencies could further diminish the carbon footprint by as much as a thousandfold compared to traditional models. This preliminary research suggests that integrating psychiatric principles into AI development could optimize performance and substantially lower energy consumption and carbon emissions, unveiling new avenues for future investigation. © 2024 AEIT.","AI Mental Health; Energy Consumption; Exploratory Study; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Training Energy Expenditures","AI mental health; Carbon emissions; Energy expenditure; Energy usage; Energy-consumption; Exploratory studies; Exponential expansion; Generative artificial intelligence; Mental health; Training energy expenditure","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210805546"

However, concerns about their potential negative impacts have emerged within the academic community. To solve the debate, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of how GAI tools influence the learning process and outcomes. Drawing upon the Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST), this study investigates the impacts of two types of GAI usage namely exploitative and explorative use on two kinds of learning performance (e.g., routine and innovative learning performance) through two opposite mechanisms. On the one hand, through positive reinforcement process, GAI use can improve learning performance by increasing students’ routine and creative self-efficacy. On the other hand, through the negative reinforcement process, GAI use may reduce learning performance by increasing technology dependence and deskilling. A survey of 306 GAI users was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses, and the results suggest that (1) both explorative and exploitative use positively influence routine and creative self-efficacy which in turn have positive impacts on routine and innovative performance, (2) both explorative and exploitative use positively influence technology dependence which positively affects routine and innovative performance, and (3) GAI use has no significant direct effect on deskilling but an indirect effect on deskilling through technology dependence and deskilling negatively influences innovative performance. © 2024 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner. © 2024 The Authors","AI in education (AIED); Educational resources; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Higher education; Technology in education","Contrastive Learning; Generative adversarial networks; Academic integrity; AI in education; Artificial intelligence tools; Educational experiences; Educational resource; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Teaching practices; Technology in educations; US universities; Differential privacy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208054812"

These AI tools are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, including education, where they have the potential to enhance learning experiences. While the existing literature has primarily focused on the immediate educational benefits of these tools, such as enhanced learning and efficiency, less attention has been given to how these tools influence broader social sustainability goals, including equitable access and inclusive learning environments. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by developing a theoretical research model that combines the information system (IS) success model, technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST), and privacy concerns. To evaluate the developed model, data were collected from 773 university students who were active users of Generative AI and analyzed using the PLS-SEM technique. The findings showed that service quality, system quality, and information quality have a significant positive effect on user satisfaction. Using Generative AI tools is found to be positively affected by user satisfaction. Interestingly, the findings supported the positive role of Generative AI in promoting social sustainability. However, no significant negative correlation was found between privacy concerns and Generative AI use.

The survey was completed by 2252 teachers, of whom 16.30% were men and 83.70% were women. The majority of the teachers (72%) reported some level of familiarity with AI technology. Higher levels of familiarity were significantly associated with younger teachers (aged 20 to 29), mathematics, sciences, and technology subject areas, as well as the male gender. More than 50% of the teachers reported using AI technology in their instruction. Familiarity with AI technology was the only significant predictor of AI use, overriding the effect of other variables. The teachers used AI technology to prepare teaching, assessment, and homework materials; design individual and team tasks; and grade students' work. The teachers who regularly used AI technology were more favorable towards AI in contrast to those who seldom or never employed AI. The majority of the respondents recognized the need for teacher training in AI technology and expressed willingness to participate in teacher training initiatives. Therefore, the current situation requires teacher education programs to harness teachers’ needs by equipping them with relevant AI literacy and skills that they could apply to the critical adoption of suitable AI tools.

The context of generative artificial intelligence could impact different aspects of students’ learning, such as the motivational aspect. The present research intended to investigate the characteristics of students’ task motivation in the artificial intelligence context, specifically in the ChatGPT context. The researchers interviewed 15 students about their experiences with ChatGPT to collect data. The researchers used inductive and deductive content analysis to investigate students’ motivation when learning with ChatGPT. To arrive at the categories and sub-categories of students’ motivation, the researchers used the MAXQDA 2022. Five main categories emerged: task enjoyment, reported effort, result assessment, perceived relevance, and interaction. Each category comprised at least two sub-categories, and each sub-category was further organized into codes. The results indicated more positive characteristics of motivation than negative ones. The previous results could be due to the conversational or social aspect of the chatbot, enabling relationships with humans and enabling the maintenance of good quality conversations with them. We conclude that a generative AI could be utilized in educational settings to promote students’ motivation to learn and thus raise their learning achievement. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; higher education; task motivation","Artificial intelligence; Social aspects; Students; Artificial intelligence tools; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Content analysis; High educations; Higher education students; Perceived relevances; Student learning; Student motivation; Task motivation; Motivation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183151751"

By engaging in dialogue with students, it provides personalized support for their reading and writing, which are fundamental aspects of EFL instruction. Although research on students’ interaction with ChatGPT is emerging, there is a lack of focus on their Processing Tactic towards ChatGPT’s Feedback (PTCF) and its impact on learning outcomes. To mitigate this gap, we employed a learning analytic method combining cluster analysis and process mining to analyze multimodal data generated during their reading and writing tasks. The analysis identified three clusters of students’ PTCF: (1) Silence with no response, (2) Passive dependence, and (3) Active construction. By conducting sequence analysis on these behavior patterns, it was found that learners adopted three learning modes when using ChatGPT, which are Comprehension-focused, Tool-inspired, and Thinking-alienator. The findings also revealed differences in learning gains among groups of students with varying learning modes, specifically in the improvement of domain knowledge.

In the tourism and hospitality industry, customer service may be revolutionized in the hotel business by implementing chatbots. These AI chatbots increase client trust through customization, anonymity, and empathetic answers. Their advantages, including contextual awareness and natural language processing, are revolutionizing how consumers look for information and make decisions. Their perceived usefulness, humor, and ease of use are key criteria that make them preferable. AI chatbots positively affect consumer behavior by raising the caliber of interactions and willingness to pay for hotel services. For example, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines uses a chatbot named Blue-Bot to answer questions about booking, boarding, and other travel-related inquiries; the City of San Francisco uses a chatbot called Muni Bot to provide information about public transportation options; Hilton Hotels uses a chatbot to answer questions about reservations, amenities, and other hotel-related inquiries. Understanding these aspects and successfully utilizing AI technologies will enable hotels to improve client experiences, offer round-theclock assistance, and expedite service delivery in the hospitality sector. Therefore, this chapter is aimed at examining the current uses and obstacles associated with Chatbots, implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) and other related symbols as well as suggesting a roadmap for potential research under this area. © 2024 by IGI Global.

It concentrates on key elements such as employee engagement, trust in GenAI and attitudes toward its implementation. This exploration is motivated by the ongoing evolution of GenAI, which presents managers with the crucial task of understanding and integrating this technology into their strategic frameworks. Design/methodology/approach: We collected 251 responses from managers and senior managers representing companies that have embraced GenAI in Spain. A hierarchical regression analysis was employed to examine the hypotheses. Subsequently, mediating effects and moderated mediation effects were scrutinized using the bias-corrected bootstrapping method. Findings: The data analysis suggests a significant enhancement in employee engagement and performance from a managerial perspective, attributed to improved attitudes and trust toward the adoption of GenAI. This conclusion is drawn from our research conducted with samples collected in Spain. Notably, our findings indicate that while positive attitudes toward GenAI correlate with enhanced engagement and performance, there exists a weakening effect on the significant positive impact of GenAI adoption in the workplace. This suggests that GenAI is still in its early stages of adoption within these companies, necessitating additional time for managers to develop greater confidence in its efficacy.

Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: ""how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns""? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Authorship; Copyright Concern; Copyright Regulations; GAI Governance; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Independent Intellectual Effort","Generative adversarial networks; Artificial intelligence systems; Authorship; Copyright concern; Copyright regulations; Design-science researches; Generative artificial intelligence; Generative artificial intelligence governance; Independent intellectual effort; Research challenges; Research methodologies","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213249533"

SMEs, particularly startups, can obtain a competitive edge, innovate their business models, gain business value, and undergo a digital transformation by implementing these technologies. Continuous but gradual experimentation with these technologies is the foundation for their adoption. The experience that comes from trying new technologies can help entrepreneurs adopt new technologies more strategically and experiment more with them. The urgent need for an in-depth investigation is highlighted by the paucity of previous research on ChatGPT uptake in the startup context, particularly from an entrepreneurial perspective. The objective of this research study is to empirically validate the Generative AI technology adoption model to establish the direction and strength of the correlations among the adoption factors from the perspectives of the entrepreneurs. The data are collected from 482 entrepreneurs who exhibit great diversity in their genders, the countries in which their startups are located, the industries their startups serve, their age, their educational levels, their work experience as entrepreneurs, and the length of time the startups have been on the market. Collected data are analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, which results in a statistical examination of the relationships between the adoption model’s factors. The results indicate that social influence, domain experience, technology familiarity, system quality, training and support, interaction convenience, and anthropomorphism are the factors that impact the pre-perception and perception phase of adoption. These factors motivate entrepreneurs to experiment more with the technology, thereby building perceptions of its usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment, three factors that in turn affect emotions toward the technology and, finally, switching intentions. Control variables like age, gender, and educational attainment have no appreciable effect on switching intentions to alternatives of the Generative AI technology. Rather, the experience factor of running businesses shows itself to be a crucial one. The results have practical implications for entrepreneurs and other innovation ecosystem actors, including, for instance, technology providers, libraries, and policymakers. This research study enriches the Generative AI technology acceptance theory and extends the existing literature by introducing new adoption variables and stages specific to entrepreneurship. © 2024 by the author.","Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT); entrepreneurs; Generative Artificial Intelligence; small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); technology adoption","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188907466"

Since November 2022, with the emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this end, a systematic review has been carried out of both the tools and the scientific production that has emerged in the six months since the appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many of the problems associated with these technologies in educational contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our teaching practice. © 2024, Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD).

The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap, whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans, as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the developers and end users. This gap between human and technological intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral (and technological) status of AI. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Ethics of artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Philosophy of technology","Ethical technology; AI systems; Ethic of artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Human capability; Image creation; Image modeling; Intentionality; Language model; Philosophy of technology; Pressung; Artificial intelligence","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197668912"

These initial concerns led to a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary study to assess the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) against assessment tasks used across 10 engineering subjects, showcasing the capability of GenAI. Assessment types included online quiz, numerical, oral, visual, programming and writing (experimentation, project, reflection and critical thinking, and research). Twelve months later, the study was repeated using new and updated tools ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini, SciSpace and Wolfram. The updated study investigated the performance and capability differences, identifying the best tool for each assessment type. The findings show that increased performance and features can only heighten academic integrity concerns. While cheating concerns are central, opportunities to integrate GenAI to enhance teaching and learning are possible.

This research examines the perceptions of Saudi Arabian higher education students towards accepting and using Gemini for academic purposes. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a self-administered questionnaire was used; 400 forms were completed and validated for analysis from seven public universities in Saudi Arabia. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS was adopted to examine the research hypotheses. The major findings agree with UTAUT and prior studies to some extent in terms of the positive influence of performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), and social influence (SI) on students’ intention to utilize Gemini, as well as the influence only of PE on the actual use of Gemini. However, the findings differ from previous research regarding the influence of facilitating conditions (FC) on students’ intention to utilize Gemini; the results were significant but negative. In addition, EE, SI, and FC did not directly affect the actual use of Gemini. These results were due to the lack of valid resources, assistance, and guidance from educational authorities and external sources about the ideal use of Gemini. Furthermore, the findings exposed that BI partially mediates the connection between PE and Gemini’s actual usage and fully mediates between EE and SI and Gemini’s actual usage. © 2024.

For each of the two models, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the five dimensions were computed across all the universities. The rating score difference for each of the five dimensions between the two models was calculated for each university. The mean of the absolute values, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimension between the two models were calculated across all universities. A paired sample t-test was then applied to each dimension for the rating score differences between the two models over all the universities. Finally, a correlation coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each dimension between the two models across all the universities. Among other collateral findings, the two models’ ratings were found almost flawlessly consistent for the five dimensions with the correlation coefficients ranging from .851 to .908 (p all at 0.000).

Employing ChatGPT to assist with marking written assessment presents multiple advantages including scalability, improved consistency, eliminating biases associated with human subjectivity. This work aimed to evaluate the usefulness, reliability and accuracy of ChatGPT in marking written assessments of varied types and to identify its limitations and challenges. ChatGPT was instructed using a set of prompts to mark the assessment based on a rubric. ChatGPT was able to evaluate and assess both coding and reflective assessments and to distinguish between assignments of different quality, demonstrating high consistency and accuracy for higher quality assessments, comparable to a human marking. ChatGPT was also able to generate textual detailed justifications based on the rubric and assessment task description. There was a significant difference in the outcomes generated by different prompts. These preliminary findings suggest that utilising ChatGPT as a marking assistant can increase written assessment marking efficiency, reduce cost and potentially decrease the unfairness and bias by providing a moderating perspective. Implications for practice or policy: • Assessment designers could reconsider the design, purpose and objectives of written assessments and leverage ChatGPT effectively for teaching and learning. • Assessors might consider adapting the technology as a grading aid, to support a human-in-the-loop grading process, providing additional resources and time, moderating and refining individual feedback, to increase consistency and quality. • Curriculum and programme leaders could develop guidelines around the ethical use of generative AI-assisted assessment practice, monitor and regulate the ongoing evaluation and refinement.

However, little is known about how students from various disciplines engage with GenAI tools. This study explores undergraduate students' GenAI knowledge, usage intentions, and task-specific engagement across academic disciplines. Using a disciplinary categorization framework, we examine how the hard/soft and pure/applied dimensions relate to students' interactions with GenAI. We surveyed 193 undergraduates from diverse disciplines at a university in Singapore. The questionnaire assessed students' GenAI knowledge, usage intentions, and engagement with GenAI for cognitive and routine tasks against their disciplinary background. The results indicate substantial disciplinary disparities in the level of engagement of students with GenAI. Compared to pure fields, applied fields (both hard and soft) consistently exhibit higher levels of GenAI knowledge and utilization intentions. Furthermore, the engagement of GenAI in routine tasks is relatively consistent across disciplines; however, there are substantial disparities in cognitive tasks, with applied fields exhibiting higher engagement. These results suggest that the practical orientation of applied fields drives GenAI adoption and utilization in academic settings. The study emphasizes considering disciplinary differences to better integrate GenAI into higher education and calls for tailored approaches that align with each field's unique epistemological and methodological traditions to balance GenAI's practical benefits with the preservation of core disciplinary knowledge and skills. © The Author(s) 2024.","Academic disciplines; Generative artificial intelligence; Task engagement; Technology adoption; Undergraduate students","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209793955"

In this article, ChatGPT's influence on university education was examined. information linking the impact and usability of ChatGPT was collected for conducting the exams, solving programming exams, and term papers by examining over 50 essay papers from learners. The essay papers were chosen from different topics. Some of the essay papers chosen are those that had been done and completed in previous academic work. Different tool misuse levels were assessed, starting from the use of it as an assistant to simplify copying its outputs. In this case, How copying and pasting material directly from ChatGPTs can affect students' grades was deeply examined and compared since some of its answers are not termed correct. This issue is broadly discussed in this article. While it shows how this tool can be used to commit exam cheating, the article also touches on the potentially significant pros of the learning sector. For example, it might be used as help to describe challenges encountered while handling an assignment or to fasten the process of learning. The outcome showed that ChatGPT can assist scientists to generate coherent papers, accurate, informative, and systematic.

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data.

While automated mechanical grab systems are necessary for efficient debris removal, their deployment in outdoor environments has been non-existent due to safety concerns. Here we report the successful use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and a Vision Language Model (VLM) to endow an automated mechanical grab with “awareness”, which allows it to differentiate between non-living and living objects, deciding whether to initiate or abort grabbing actions. The existing approaches such as YOLOv7 only achieve a sensitivity of 86.94% (95% CI: 83.44% to 89.93%) in detecting humans and specified animals. They systematically miss crouching workers and animals facing away from the cameras. Grounding DINO (VLM) can achieve a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 99.17% to 100.00%) and a specificity of 85.37% (95% CI: 77.86% to 91.09%). Together with BLIP-2 (GenAI), it acquires “awareness”, allowing it to detect animals beyond those specified. This opens up possibilities for the application of GenAI/VLM in automation sectors where human-machine mingling occurs, such as manufacturing, logistics, and construction. This innovation can potentially improve the safety and efficiency in these domains. © 2024 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.","Artificial intelligence; computer vision; debris clearance; flood management; machine learning model; object detection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212971682"

We engage a particular definition of trust and the object-oriented model of trust that was built upon it and identify how at least four implicit assumptions may no longer hold. Those assumptions include that people generally provide others with a default level of trust, the ability to identify whether the trusted agent is human or artificial, that risk and trust can be readily quantified or categorized, and that there is no expectation of gain by agents engaged in trust relationships. Based on that analysis, we suggest modifications to the definition and model to accommodate the features of generative AI chatbots. Our changes re-emphasize developers’ responsibility for the impacts of their AI artifacts, no matter how sophisticated the artifact may be. The changes also reflect that trust relationships are more fraught when participants in such relationships are not confident in identifying the nature of a potential trust partner. © 2024 by the authors.","chatbots; e-trust; generative artificial intelligence; trust","Bot (Internet); Generative adversarial networks; Chatbots; Critical analysis; E trusts; Generative artificial intelligence; Object oriented modelling; Trust; Trust relationship; Trusted agents; Chatbots","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205265818"

In the past two years, several generative models have disrupted worldwide, including ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, developed by OpenAI, which are currently receiving significant media attention. These models can generate new content, respond to prompts, and automatically create new images and videos. Nevertheless, despite this progress of GAI, research into its application in business and industry is still in its infancy. Generative AI is bringing ground-breaking innovations that go beyond the limitations of conventional Contextual AI. This new type of AI can generate novel patterns in human-like creativity, encompassing various forms of content such as text, images, and media. It transforms how people communicate, create, and share content, taking organizations by surprise. Unfortunately, these organizations were not fully prepared as they were focused on the advancements and impacts of Contextual AI. Given the significant organizational-societal opportunities and challenges posed by generative models, it is crucial to comprehend their ramifications. However, the excessive hype surrounding GAI currently makes it difficult to determine how organizations can effectively utilize and regulate these powerful algorithms. In research, the primary question is how organizations can manage the intersection of human creativity and machine creativity, and how can they leverage this intersection to their advantage? To address this question and mitigate concerns related to it, a comprehensive understanding of GAI is essential. Therefore, this paper aims to provide technical insights into this paradigm and analyze its potential, opportunities, and constraints for business and industrial research. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","business; ChatGPT; Contextual Artificial Intelligence; DALL-E 2; Generative Artificial Intelligence; industry","Industrial research; Artificial intelligence research; Breakings; ChatGPT; Contextual artificial intelligence; DALL-E 2; Generative artificial intelligence; Generative model; ITS applications; Media attention; Novel patterns; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174623920"

Designed as part of a two-and-a-half-day of the MED Summer School (associazione Italiana di Media Education) on Artificial Intelligence and Media Education, the workshop gathered 20 participants-primarily educators and PhD students- and focused on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), fake news, and media education. The goal was to foster a critical understanding of GAI tools in the media and information production landscape, promote the ability to consciously generate content using GAI, and facilitate the transfer of this experience to both school settings and active, informed citizenship. The workshop adopted David Merrill's principles of instructional design, focusing on ""learning by doing"" and co-design, where participants were actively involved in practical tasks and problem-solving activities. This methodological approach emphasized media production and reflection, fostering design thinking and strategic reflection on the role of AI in media and educational contexts. The main objective was to collaboratively articulate media education strategies, including best practices around the use of algorithms and AI in media environments. Participants engaged in a series of activities that combined hands-on media production with critical analysis, resulting in the co-design of a set of operational guidelines. These guidelines, aimed at enhancing the understanding and use of AI tools in media education, provided practical strategies for application in diverse educational settings. Emphasizing metacognition and reflection, the workshop encouraged participants to critically assess AI's influence on media for fostering informed and active citizenship. The workshop concluded with a plenary session to create guidelines for Expert prompter. Through this experience, participants developed a deeper understanding of the challenges AI poses to information and the tools needed to address them in an educational context. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This potential for bias has grown progressively more important in recent years as GAI has become increasingly integrated in multiple critical sectors, such as healthcare, consumer lending, and employment. While much of the study of gender bias in popular GAI systems is focused on text-based GAI such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard), this article describes the results of a confirmatory experiment of gender bias in visual GAI systems. The authors argue that the potential for gender bias in visual GAI systems is potentially more troubling than bias in textual GAI because of the superior memorability of images and the capacity for emotional communication that images represent.

The paper systematizes the practical experience of using GPT in education and suggests the possibility of its application for the development and evaluation of students’ thinking. The case of using neural network YandexGPT in teaching students the basics of entrepreneurship in terms of generating innovative ideas and developing product concepts for specific markets is considered. A pedagogical design is proposed and a comparative experimental study is conducted to determine the possibilities and limitations of using neural networks for students to quickly immerse themselves in the topic and generate innovative ideas. To interpret the results of the experiment we used the method of expert evaluations, semantic analysis of prompts and neural network responses to student queries and statistical methods of hypothesis testing, in particular the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis criterion. It is shown that students have different levels of practical skills in using GPT and lack of critical thinking for solving practical problems. Nevertheless, the use of GPT allowed student teams under time constraints to achieve results and present their concept of an innovative product for a specific market. According to the results of the experiment it is concluded that for more effective use of GPT language models in educational activities it is necessary to pre-train students in the basics of prompt-engineering and to develop new pedagogical methods of GPT application in various fields of knowledge. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","critical thinking; generative artificial intelligence; GPT; higher education; innovative idea generation; pilot study; product thinking; STI Markets","Generative adversarial networks; Students; Teaching; Critical thinking; Generative artificial intelligence; GPT; High educations; Idea generation; Innovative idea generation; Innovative ideas; Pilot studies; Product thinking; STI market; Commerce","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210322990"

This study evaluated and compared ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Bard within dental education and research. Methods: We developed seven dental education-related queries to assess each model across various domains: their role in dental education, creation of specific exercises, simulations of dental problems with treatment options, development of assessment tools, proficiency in dental literature and their ability to identify, summarise and critique a specific article. Two blind reviewers scored the responses using defined metrics. The means and standard deviations of the scores were reported, and differences between the scores were analysed using Wilcoxon tests. Results: ChatGPT 3.5 outperformed Bard in several tasks, including the ability to create highly comprehensive, accurate, clear, relevant and specific exercises on dental concepts, generate simulations of dental problems with treatment options and develop assessment tools. On the other hand, Bard was successful in retrieving real research, and it was able to critique the article it selected. Statistically significant differences were noted between the average scores of the two models (p ≤ 0.05) for domains 1 and 3. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of LLMs as dental education tools, enhancing learning through virtual simulations and critical performance analysis. However, the variability in LLMs' performance underscores the need for targeted training, particularly in evidence-based content generation. It is crucial for educators, students and practitioners to exercise caution when considering the delegation of critical educational or healthcare decisions to computer systems. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This paper systematically identifies and analyses the self-regulatory framework for the implementation of artificial intelligence in the Portuguese media ecosystem. The study is based on the empirical evidence presented by Becker et al (2023), which indicates that national and organisational idiosyncrasies play an important role in defining the practices of the media, both of which are responsible for some of the variations observed in the results of their study that examined 52 documents regulating the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in journalism. A methodology was established to identify and analyse newsrooms' self-regulatory documents, so that future monitoring can be carried out through replication, contributing to reflection on the field of study. The research identified patterns consistent with international trends in the regulation of AI in journalistic contexts, including fundamental concerns with transparency, editorial responsibility and maintaining professional integrity. At the same time, the analysis reveals distinctive features that reflect the specificities of the Portuguese media context, particularly with regard to the specificities of the media organisations. The results suggest that although Portugal is at an early stage of adapting to AI in journalism, there is an emerging movement towards establishing self-regulatory frameworks. © 2024 (Pinto-Martinho).","AI Codes of Conduct in Journalism; Artificial Intelligence; Ethics; Journalism; Letters of Principle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213259607"

Although the impact of ChatGPT on academic integrity processes is a key concern, little is known about whether academics can reliably recognise texts that have been generated by AI. This qualitative study applies Turing's Imitation Game to investigate 16 education academics’ perceptions of two pairs of texts written by either ChatGPT or a human. Pairs of texts, written in response to the same task, were used as the stimulus for interviews that probed academics’ perceptions of text authorship and the textual features that were important in their decision-making. Results indicated academics were only able to identify AI-generated texts half of the time, highlighting the sophistication of contemporary generative AI technology. Academics perceived the following categories as important for their decision-making: voice, word usage, structure, task achievement and flow. All five categories of decision-making were variously used to rationalise both accurate and inaccurate decisions about text authorship. The implications of these results are discussed with a particular focus on what strategies can be applied to support academics more effectively as they manage the ongoing challenge of AI in higher education. © (2023) Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE).","assessment; ChatGPT; education academics; generative artificial intelligence (AI); Imitation Game; initial teacher education; thematic analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183566149"

With scant research on a guided framework, strategies, and checklists for the utilization of GenAI, we propose a framework based on the expertise acquisition model, information retrieval theory, and deontological ethics theory, emphasizing the need for domain knowledge, query capabilities, and ethical acumen (DEQ). Using a ‘thing’ ethnography methodology with ChatGPT, we validated our framework, highlighting the importance of these competencies to mitigate risks, including the generation of factually incorrect and plagiarized content. Our findings suggest that while GenAI can drive innovation, its content should be used as a guiding tool to enhance critical thinking and reasoning, ultimately helping knowledge workers and students avoid plagiarism and maintain academic integrity.

While AI can enhance efficiency and innovation, it raises questions about the changing role of designers and the potential risks associated with reduced human control. The rapid growth of AI technology in UX/UI design requires a comprehensive understanding of how AI can effectively complement human creativity and intuition, ensuring high-quality design outcomes while addressing concerns about job displacement and autonomy. This study develops a research framework that explores the interplay between AI applications and human skills in the context of modern UX/UI design. The framework aims to examine the impact of AI on design quality and how various factors moderate this influence. The hypotheses suggest that AI applications and user skills have a positive effect on design quality, but their impact is moderated by factors such as design complexity, user expectations, and collaboration. The research methodology combines literature review, data collection through surveys, data analysis, and expert evaluation to test these hypotheses rigorously. This research provides a foundation for further exploration of AI’s role in UI/UX design, offering opportunities for examining its impact in diverse organizational contexts, user groups, and long-term UX effects. Ultimately, the study aims to enhance UI/UX design practices through informed AI integration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Artificial Intelligence; Design quality; UX/UI design","Design for manufacturability; Artificial intelligence tools; Design Quality; Human control; Potential risks; Rapid growth; Research frameworks; User experience/user interface design; User Interface design process; User interface designs; Users' experiences","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208183282"

How does the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), based on large language models (LLMs), fit into the IR process? Process: This perspective explores the use of generative AI in the context of the motivations, considerations, and outcomes of the IR process with a focus on the academic use of such systems. Conclusions: There are many information needs, from simple to complex, that motivate use of IR. Users of such systems, particularly academics, have concerns for authoritativeness, timeliness, and contextualization of search. While LLMs may provide functionality that aids the IR process, the continued need for search systems, and research into their improvement, remains essential.  © 2024 The Author(s).

The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the potentials and pitfalls of using ChatGPT for academic purposes among university students, as well as provide relevant pedagogical implications for its use in academia. The methodology is based on a mix-method approach, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative by analysing an online questionnaire that was distributed among both Czech and foreign students at a university in the Czech Republic. The findings of this study reveal ChatGPT’s burgeoning significance as an academic instrument, alongside concerns regarding its constraints and potential misuse. Most students employ ChatGPT for academic purposes, as demonstrated by the favorable feedback it receives for its effectiveness in facilitating research, stimulating idea generation, promoting comprehension of intricate concepts, and furnishing prompt responses. Hence, ChatGPT embodies promise for forthcoming generations regarding its capacity to augment educational programs, potentially fostering greater efficiency and interactivity in the learning process. Nevertheless, a critical apprehension lies in students excessively relying on ChatGPT, which may impede the cultivation of vital skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Therefore, the authors of this study provide several pedagogical implications for its use in academia, such as using ChatGPT as a supportive tool in classes, as well as using it for collaborative work and group tasks since ChatGPT promotes sharing information, faster collection of data, providing diverse and creative ideas, or speed communication. Another important pedagogical implication is raising awareness of ethical guidelines, given that many students remain oblivious to them, necessitating the training of teachers to impart ethical usage of ChatGPT. Finally, the results of this study align with several educational theories, such as constructivism or self-determination theory. © 2024 The Author(s).
