Describes the use of artificial intelligence in several aspects of commerce and discusses the potential applications of AI in retail, concluding with a broad recommendation for future AI research. The popularity of artificial intelligence can be attributed to a variety of valid reasons. Take the following example into consideration. In order to set up future automatic bill payments, you must transfer funds from your savings account to your checking account at your retail bank. If you were dealing with conventional retail banking, you would have needed to go to the nearest branch and make a cash transfer. Human or automated teller machines would be used for this purpose. Mobile banking allows you to make transfers by simply logging into your device and selecting the appropriate button. What if your wearable device or smartphone could tell you what to do? To complete this transaction? During this process, you should seek advice from a professional. What are the best methods for managing your finances and making wise financial decisions? Erica is a voice-activated artificial intelligence-based virtual financial assistant available through Bank of America's mobile app. Additionally, Erica quick completion of the desired transaction, it also provides advice on a variety of financial matters, such as the capacity to reduce mortgage payments by adhering to option for refinancing, warning clients of suspicious activities in their accounts, displaying their most recent credit score as a result, and providing suggestions to improve it.Retail has seen the arrival of AI! Consumers' everyday routines and retail transactions are being influenced by it. Retail data continue to soar, with corporate data doubling every 1.2 years. Purchase information, online browsing information, and data from social media, mobile device activity, and client data on satisfaction. For instance, a merchant like Walmart has around one million exchanges per hour, adding 2.5 terabytes of information to the total. AI programs in retail are suitable for training on massive datasets. The development and usage of AI. Utilizing these expanding data, retailers are putting money into various AI applications. I estimate that shops will invest $6 billion on AI by 2022. AI has an effect on both the supply and demand sides. On AI is assisting retailers to better comprehend the demand side and anticipate consumer wants, as well as make the best choices to increase a customer's lifetime value. Regarding supply on the plus side, AI is making supply networks more effective. and enhance logistics and inventory control. AI is helping consumers and shoppers make decisions, their interaction with shops will change.","","979-8-3503-2230-9","10.1109/AISC56616.2023.10085624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085624","Artificial intelligence;Value chain;Retail Technology;Business and Developments","Industries;Training;Supply and demand;Wearable computers;Supply chains;Transportation;Medical services","","","","16","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3432101","Melbourne Institute of Technology (MIT) administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10629211","4E framework;academic evaluation matrix (AVM);academic integrity;education;generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)","Education;Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Privacy;Stakeholders;Uncertainty;Training","","","","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this paper proposes a data mining algorithm to evaluate and analyze the mechanism of optimization and innovation. Firstly, the relative income consumption theory is used to evaluate the consumer market, and the indicators are divided according to the requirements of the mechanism evaluation to reduce the interference factors in the evaluation of the mechanism. Then, the relative income consumption theory evaluates the mechanism of consumption upgrading level, forms a mechanism evaluation scheme, and comprehensively analyzes the evaluation results of the mechanism. MATLAB simulation shows that under certain evaluation criteria, the evaluation accuracy of the mechanism of data mining algorithms on the level of consumption upgrading and the quality of consumption structure transformation and upgrading are better than those of traditional consumption patterns.","","979-8-3503-8269-3","10.1109/ICITEICS61368.2024.10625343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10625343","relative income consumption theory;data mining algorithms;consumption structure;Artificial intelligence","Deep learning;Technological innovation;Production;Interference;Mathematical models;Data mining;Artificial intelligence","","","","11","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims to explore pre-service art teachers' attitudes toward using the current AI art generator and their perceptions of using it in their future careers. 45 Pre-service art teachers with no AI art generator experience participated and were distributed into eight groups. They used the AI art generator to draw pictures by selecting and revising keywords. They could discuss keywords within their groups. In the first round, the participants need to draw a similar picture as the trainer displayed. In the second round, participants could draw any picture they liked according to their own opinions. After class, participants filled out an online questionnaire concerning their experience of using the AI art generator and their opinions of using it in their future careers, including keywords they used and the times of keyword revision. Half of the groups thought that the AI art generator did not create the pictures they wanted according to the keywords they provided, and the times at which the keywords changed in these groups were much higher than in the other groups. Participants who thought the AI generated the pictures they wanted showed a much higher preference for using AI in the future. The majority of pre-service art teachers were interested in AI art generators. They believed that AI tools could help them prepare course materials, provide inspiration, and benefit their interactions with students in the future.

The Keynesian theory suggests that employment is directly related to aggregate demand in the economy and that government intervention can help stabilize employment levels. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to create disruption in the employment patterns that are traditional as the machines are rapidly becoming able to perform the tasks that are done by humans. This paper studies the potential impact of AI on both skilled and unskilled labor markets. The current study argues that while artificial intelligence can enhance the productivity and output, it may also expand the income inequality and lead to job displacement for certain segments of the workforce. The paper also discusses the role of government intervention in response to the potential effects of AI on employment. The paper argues that government policies, such as education and retraining programmes, are necessary to ascertain that the workforce is able to adapt to the changing dynamics of labour market. Therefore, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment generation is both multi-dimensional and tangled and Keynesian theory provides a useful framework for understanding the impact of AI on employment as well as the role of government intervention in response.","","979-8-3503-1706-0","10.1109/ICCAMS60113.2023.10525818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10525818","employment;artificial intelligence;labour market;government policies","Training;Adaptation models;Aggregates;Employment;Government;Stability analysis;Artificial intelligence","","","","15","IEEE","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are inherent challenges in achieving this inclusiveness, primarily due to biases embedded in AI learning databases and the design and development processes of AI systems. The study offers a comprehensive examination of AI's potential to revolutionize PM by enabling managers to concentrate more on people-centric aspects of their work. This is achieved through AI’s ability to perform tasks such as data collection, reporting, and predictive analysis more consistently and efficiently than human counterparts. However, the incorporation of AI in PM extends beyond mere efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in the epistemology of PM, calling for a deeper understanding of AI's role and impact on society. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI comes with significant challenges, particularly in terms of bias and inclusiveness. Biased AI learning databases, which use shared and reusable datasets, often perpetuate initially discriminatory algorithms. Moreover, unconscious biases and stereotypes of AI designers, developers, and trainers can inadvertently influence the behavior of the AI systems they create. This necessitates a paradigmatic shift in how AI systems are developed and governed to ensure they do not replicate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. The research proposes a methodological approach involving the development of criteria for inclusion and exclusion, alongside data extraction, to evaluate the inclusiveness and efficiency of AI software in enhancing PM. This approach is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges and limitations of AI in the context of PM. By focusing on inclusiveness, the study underscores the importance of a synergy between technological advancement and ethical consideration, demanding a comprehensive understanding and regulation to mitigate risks and maximize benefits. In conclusion, this paper presents a detailed exploration of AI’s role in PM highlighting both its potential benefits and the ethical challenges it poses. The findings and recommendations of this study contribute to the growing discourse on the need for inclusive AI systems in PM, offering insights for AI developers and Project Managers (PMs) alike.","","979-8-3503-9452-8","10.1109/ACDSA59508.2024.10467463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10467463","artificial intelligence;project management;explainable artificial intelligence;styling;inclusiveness","Ethics;Databases;Reviews;Project management;Software;Regulation;Software measurement","","","","30","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this study aims to critically evaluate the impact of AI usage on recruitment biases, particularly in the context of China. The data were gathered through a survey of 423 respondents working in the manufacturing sector. We use a cross-sectional dataset and various diagnostics (i.e., reliability and collinearity tests). The empirical findings using multivariate regression techniques suggested that Al usage is reshaping the recruitment process by offering innovative solutions to tackle biases that have pervaded the hiring process for years. However, human involvement is indispensable in the recruitment process, alongside the use of AI. Although the use of AI can efficiently handle tasks such as resume screening and data analysis, human judgment brings essential qualities to the hiring process. Human recruiters possess the ability to assess a candidate's soft skills, cultural fit, and emotional intelligence, as these qualities are challenging for AI to comprehend. The policy implications of the study recommend that by combining the strengths of AI efficiency with human insight, organizations can create a recruitment process that is not only objective and efficient but also considerate, ethical, and aligned with the values and goals of the company.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2024.3442618","Excellence Project at the Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czechia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10634779","Artificial intelligence (AI);human resource management;recruitment biases","Artificial intelligence;Recruitment;Companies;Data analysis;Task analysis;Reliability;Productivity","","","","73","CCBY","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle.

This group requires comprehensive physical, mental, and functional care. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved nursing capabilities by enabling real-time health monitoring, thus bolstering the early detection and prevention of severe health issues. Despite these advancements, the current systematic literature predominantly focuses on machine learning (ML) applications for a limited set of chronic diseases, often overlooking the extensive capabilities of deep learning (DL) technologies. Additionally, these reviews cover a narrow spectrum of studies, potentially needing broader insights and developments in the field. To address these shortcomings, our study conducts a systematic literature review of ML and DL applications in geriatric care for chronic disease management. We meticulously analyzed peer-reviewed articles published from 2014 to 2024, concentrating on AI technologies in elderly care. This review included 76 selected articles from leading publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, IEEE, MDPI, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Nature, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, and arXiv, which we categorized into three main groups: Neurological disorders (27 articles), Mental Health disorders (22 articles), and Physical/physiological disorders (27 articles). Our findings reveal that Random Forest, logistic regression, and convolutional neural network (CNN) are the most frequently used AI techniques, typically evaluated by accuracy metrics and the area under the curve (AUC). The findings indicate that although AI applications in geriatric care are promising, they require significant enhancements in technology and methodology to improve accuracy and reliability. Future research should focus on developing advanced AI tools, integrating cutting-edge deep learning models and comprehensive datasets to refine diagnostics and treatment protocols for chronic diseases in the elderly, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3450970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654298","Nurse;older patients;chronic disease;artificial intelligence;machine learning;deep learning","Artificial intelligence;Diseases;Medical services;Older adults;Geriatrics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Deep learning","","","","211","CCBYNCND","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aims to investigate the impact of a family-centered care (FCC) system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms on the healing of CLLW. A FCC for Children’s CLLWs (CLLW FCC) system was designed, consisting primarily of four components: an interaction layer, a service layer, a data layer, and a hardware layer. The CNN algorithm was utilized to establish a segmentation method for chronic wound images, which was then applied to the wound management section of the CLLW FCC system, aiming to improve the nursing outcomes of children with CLLW, optimize wound management processes, and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image processing and analysis. It focused on 92 pediatric patients with CLLW admitted to our hospital from January 2022 to June 2023. The patients were randomly assigned into a control (Con) group and an observation (Obs) group, with 46 cases in each. Patients in the Con group received routine care, while those in the Obs group received FCC system for CLLW. The wound infection rate (WIR), wound healing time (WHT), wound pain scores, parental knowledge scores, and satisfaction with care (SWC) were evaluated for both the Con and Obs groups. The results unveiled that the optimized CNN algorithm achieved mean intersection over union (mIOU) and Kappa values of 0.8965 and 0.8773, respectively, which were higher than those of other algorithms. Patients in the Obs group experienced a shorter WHT and lower wound pain scores in contrast to those in the Con group ( $P\lt 0.05$ ). The parental knowledge scores were higher in the Obs group, showing great differences with those in the Con group ( $P\lt 0.05$ ). The WIR in the Obs group was 2.17%, lower to 10.87% in the Con group ( $P\lt 0.05$ ). Additionally, the overall SWC was 95.65% in the Obs group, being higher to 80.32% in the Con group. This indicated that the FCC system based on AI and CNN algorithms in this work could sharply shorten the pediatric WHT, reduce pain scores and WIR during care, and improve the parental knowledge scores and SWC.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3454769","Ideological and Political Model Courses of “War Epidemic” Courses in Undergraduate Universities in Henan Province (Jiao Gao [2020])(grant numbers:531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666761","Artificial intelligence;convolutional neural network algorithm;family-centered care system;children;chronic lower limb wounds;healing","Pediatrics;FCC;Artificial intelligence;Medical services;Pain;Convolutional neural networks;Medical treatment","","1","","50","CCBYNCND","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its output includes text, code, image, audio, speech, voice, music, and video. Therefore, it impacts education courses where students are required to elaborate on any of these artifacts. In particular, the generation of code affects informatics courses, where assignments usually ask students to develop and deliver programming code. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on informatics courses has been mainly studied for introductory programming courses. These studies have shown that generative artificial intelligence is able to produce highly sophisticated programs, but also that its results and rationale can be inaccurate. Moreover, the impact of generative artificial intelligence has not been studied for other informatics subjects. In this paper, we present our preliminary experience and proposals on three advanced software courses, namely video games, advanced algorithms and language processors. For the video games course, we present the opportunities of use of generative artificial intelligence and the results of a survey conducted with students on their use to obtain different media products. For the algorithms course, we present the result of a session driven by the instructor on different design techniques, showing the merits and demerits of the answers generated. For the language processors course, a proposal of use of generative artificial intelligence is presented, broken down into the parts of a typical language processor.

Understanding their perspectives is crucial not only for shaping educational frameworks, but also for assessing students’ readiness to navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape in the modern workspace. This paper examines students’ attitudes to AI, as well as their interest in and knowledge about it. An adapted version of the Pew Research Center survey was used in our study to explore how gender and student seniority influence attitudes to AI generally and in specific applications such as facial recognition and self-driving cars. Our aim was to test the effects of these factors on AI attitudes, and to discover how various factors such as socio-demographics, knowledge, and interest may individually or collectively impact on AI attitudes in general, as well as in specific areas such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, or social media algorithms for fake news. We also investigated whether knowledge of AI and interest in it may serve to predict attitudes beyond the impacts of student seniority and gender. Our findings indicate that males self-report greater interest than females, but similar knowledge and general attitudes as female participants. Senior students possessed more AI knowledge compared to freshmen, but similar attitudes towards AI in general and self-driving cars. Interest in AI emerged as a significant predictor of general attitudes to AI and to self-driving cars, suggesting that increased interest correlates with more positive attitudes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3454801","Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia within the Framework of the “IDEAS” Program—Management of New Security Risks Research and Simulation Development, NEWSiMR&D(grant numbers:7749151); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666688","Artificial intelligence;education;technological innovation","Artificial intelligence;Education;Emotion recognition;Behavioral sciences;Gender issues;Psychology","","","","35","CCBYNCND","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.","","978-1-7281-0492-8","10.1109/AITest.2019.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718231","artificial intelligence;machine learning;security;perturbation attack;parameters tuning;optimization","Security;Artificial intelligence;Perturbation methods;Tuning;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Testing","","3","","45","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the sector’s traditionally conservative stance toward innovation has led to limited research. Thus, this manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring factors influencing the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation among mining industry employees from a developing country perspective. Based on literature reviews seven factors were identified to influence employees’ acceptance of GenAI technological innovation. These factors were examined in a data sample of 286 mining industry employees collected via an office-intercept survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS software. Through thorough data analysis, models have been constructed that exhibit robustness, evidenced by their strong validity, reliability, and excellent fit with the data. The findings reveal that attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, company size, industrial competitiveness, and top management support significantly influence the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation. Notably, attitude was identified as the most influential factor, significantly shaping the likelihood of adoption. Conversely, company size had a comparatively minor impact on acceptance, and the regulatory framework showed no significant effect on the adoption of GenAI technology innovation. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, they provide a nuanced understanding of the key factors driving technology acceptance in the mining industry, challenging the traditional emphasis on regulatory frameworks. Managerially, they underscore the importance of focusing on factors when developing strategies to foster technological adoption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3493242","King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang(grant numbers:KDS 2022/030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10746465","Acceptance;employees;generative artificial intelligence;innovation;mining industry","Mining industry;Companies;Industries;Generative AI;Developing countries;Productivity;Mathematical models;Analytical models;Vehicle dynamics","","","","54","CCBY","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a notable lack of empirical data supporting the specific impact pathways of AI language models on employment. In the present study, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we surveyed 418 English majors in a university in China to investigate the influence of perceived usefulness and ease of use of AI language models on job search self-efficacy within the context of AI language model development. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis and validation, our research yielded the following findings: First, students specializing in English maintain a relatively positive perception of the usefulness and ease of use of AI language models, coupled with an optimistic outlook on their employment prospects under the shadow of burgeoning AI language model development. Second, perceived usefulness and ease of use were found to be effective predictors of job search self-efficacy among English majors in the context of AI language model advancements. The pathways of influence are as follows: 1) Perceived ease of use directly and positively impacts perceived usefulness; 2) Both perceived usefulness and ease of use directly and positively influence job search self-efficacy; 3) Perceived ease of use indirectly and positively affects job search self-efficacy through the mediating role of perceived usefulness. Based on these findings, we proffer recommendations for language service professionals and educators.","","979-8-3503-7533-6","10.1109/IECA62822.2024.00021","Ministry of Education; Shaoguan University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10624651","Job search self-efficacy;Artificial intelligence language models;Language services;Language education","Analytical models;Technology acceptance model;Computational modeling;Employment;Education;Predictive models;Mathematical models","","","","13","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Structural equation modeling was applied to an online survey of 571 full-time employees of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Japan. The results showed that the introduction of basic technology had a positive effect on job satisfaction and the introduction of advanced technology had a positive effect on turnover intention, while removal of old technology had no significant effect. Accordingly, managers must not underestimate the basic technical environment but implement it quickly. In addition, when introducing cutting-edge technology, managers must give due consideration to employee concerns about employment security.

The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process.","2770-6834","978-1-6654-6000-2","10.1109/REW56159.2022.00037","Stanford University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920150","AI ethics;AI governance;responsible AI;impact assessment;risk-based approach","Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Conferences;Europe;Organizations;Regulation;Requirements engineering","","5","","27","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI technologies or incidents.

Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as “Smart Healthcare.” A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient.

Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy.

Germanium has high impact ionization rates to ensure that the transition from OFF state to ON state is abrupt. However, breakdown voltage of the SC device was decreased from BV=2.9V to 2.5V by increasing the composition of Ge from 10% to 30%. The same characteristics were found for DC VESIMOS where BV= 2V had decreased to 1.6V by varying the Ge composition. In short, the breakdown voltage which affected by the appearance of second SiGe channel and Ge composition was justified. Apart from that, with the presence of second SiGe channel, the switching speed and ION/IOFF of the device were improved. It was found that the sub-threshold slope of SC and DC VESIMOS were inversely proportional to the breakdown voltage.

Soft skills encompass a broad spectrum of attributes, such as effective communication, adept collaboration, nimble adaptability, and profound emotional intelligence, all of which are integral to fostering productive team environments and driving organizational success. Despite their acknowledged importance, quantifying and evaluating soft skills has traditionally been hindered by their inherently subjective nature. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has revolutionized the landscape of skill assessment, presenting novel opportunities to address these longstanding challenges. By leveraging AI-powered algorithms, organizations can now analyze vast datasets encompassing various facets of human interaction, enabling a more nuanced and objective evaluation of individuals' soft skill proficiencies. Moreover, AI-driven assessments offer scalability, allowing for the efficient evaluation of large cohorts of employees or candidates. Nonetheless, this intersection of AI and soft skills measurement is not without its obstacles. Ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for automation-induced job displacement necessitate careful scrutiny and regulation. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of soft skills presents a continuous challenge, as individuals must continually adapt and refine their abilities to meet evolving workplace demands. Despite these challenges, the synergistic relationship between AI and soft skills measurement holds immense promise for the future of talent assessment and development.

These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.","2158-3412","978-1-6654-8410-7","10.1109/ISTAS55053.2022.10227116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227116","ethical governance;artificial intelligence;regulation framework;AI regulation;AI ethics;ethical regulation","Ethics;Systematics;Regulation;Reflection;Complexity theory;Cultural differences;Artificial intelligence","","1","","13","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first approach proceeds top-down from non-formalizable, cognitive, uncaused, and chaotic human consciousness towards purposeful and sustainable human-machine interaction. The second approach proceeds bottom-up from intelligent machines towards high-end computing and is based on formalizable models leveraging multi-agent architectures. The resulting work reviews the extent, the merging points, and the potential of hybrid artificial intelligence frameworks that accept the idea of strong artificial intelligence. These models concern the pairing of connectionist and cognitive architectures, conscious and unconscious actions, symbolic and conceptual realizations, emergent and brain-based computing, and automata and subjects. The special authors’ convergent methodology is considered, which is based on the integration of inverse problem-solving on topological spaces, cognitive modelling, quantum field theory, category theory methods, and holonic approaches. It aims to a more purposeful and sustainable human-machine interaction in form of algorithms or requirements, rules of strategic conversations or network brainstorming, and cognitive semantics.

The cause for this lies in an unparalleled upswing in investment, fostering a massive expansion of technological (and business) innovations. Determining which among them qualify as inventions and meet the requirements for patent protection gives rise to inquiries that frequently necessitate a scrutiny of fundamental concepts of patent law in patent registration procedures. In this paper special emphasis is placed on European patent regulations, particularly the European Patent Convention and the practices of the European Patent Office. Assessment of the impact of artificial intelligence on existing patent law entails examination of legal concepts of the inventor and a person skilled in the art, along with the essential requirements for patentability of inventions. This analysis serves as basis for further evaluation of whether the current patent law can be adapted to the newly emerging and dynamic technological environment of artificial intelligence through interpretation, or whether it is necessary to devise a new legal framework to protect the interests of participants in the creation and use of the respective category of intellectual creations.","2623-8764","979-8-3503-8250-1","10.1109/MIPRO60963.2024.10569722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10569722","artificial intelligence;law;intellectual property;patent;invention;inventor","Patents;Technological innovation;Art;Europe;Regulation;Patent law;Artificial intelligence","","","","40","IEEE","28 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, piezoelectric polymer sensor array is utilized to realize impact location by passively monitoring complex structures due to their excellent flexibility and piezoelectric response. Here, PVDF-TrFE coatings are deposited on the structure by in-situ direct writing process and directly functionalized on structural surfaces. With the aid of this fabrication process, the piezoelectric polymer sensor's robustness, coupling effect and layout work are optimized for complex surfaces. To realize the in-situ direct writing process, a piezoelectric polymer sensing system was designed and assembled, which consists of a motion control system, a spray system, and a polarization system. Four piezoelectric polymer sensors are machined on the surface of the aluminum plate. The location results are calculated by the arrival time difference based on the envelope threshold extraction method. The experimental results show that the in-situ piezoelectric polymer sensor has perfect piezoelectric response characteristics and positioning at different heights and positions. The minimum detectable impact energy is as low as $1.5\times{10}^{-4}$ J while guaranteeing the positioning performance.","","979-8-3503-1801-2","10.1109/ICSMD60522.2023.10490772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10490772","impact detection;wave source location;PVDFTrFE;in-suit direct writing;structural health monitoring","Aluminum;Spraying;Writing;Wind turbines;Polymers;Coatings;Surface treatment","","","","20","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Impact damage is one of the most common hazards during their use, and effective feature representation of impact damage is key to its identification. In impact tests of pressure vessels, due to the enormous impact energy, the acoustic emission response signals from fiber breakage, fiber delamination, and matrix cracking are often overwhelmed by the impact energy itself, making precise representation challenging. This paper proposes a feature energy band representation method based on the Wigner-Hilbert time-frequency diagram of acoustic emission responses. An experimental protocol was designed, and Wigner-Hilbert transform was applied to the collected impact signals. An improved Faster R-CNN was used to detect feature energy band images with different aspect ratios and areas. The detected feature energy bands were found to effectively distinguish three different types of impact damage. This method can serve as a feature parameter for identifying impact damage in practical engineering applications and can be further studied as one of the parameters for recognizing the development of impact damage.","","979-8-3503-8697-4","10.1109/IoTAAI62601.2024.10692395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10692395","CFRP;impact damage;Faster R-CNN;feature energy band","Training;Time-frequency analysis;Protocols;Pressure vessels;Transforms;Acoustic emission;Wounds;Feature extraction;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber testing","","","","11","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After the droplet impact on the wall, it will undergo morphological changes such as spreading and rebound, which are closely related to the droplet characteristics and wall structure. In this paper, CUDA-based lattice Boltzmann multiphase flow method was used to simulate droplet movement after impact on the wall, and the effects of impact velocity, surface wettability and surface morphology on droplet impact were studied. The results show that the higher the initial impact velocity, the higher the droplet rebound height. The higher the surface hydrophobicity, the higher the rebound height of the droplet when impacting the wall with different wettability. The droplet bounce height on the rough wall of the circular structure is the largest when it hits the rough wall of different shape structures, which is mainly because the hydrophobicity of the wall is enhanced geometrically by the circular structure. These simulation and research results are expected to provide some data reference and theoretical basis for the application and research in related fields.","","979-8-3503-2671-0","10.1109/CAIT59945.2023.10469016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10469016","Numerical simulation;Droplet impact;CUDA;Lattice Boltzmann method","Shape;Surface morphology;Graphics processing units;Morphology;Numerical simulation;Hydrodynamics;Surface roughness","","","","13","IEEE","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are people who believe that AI has a positive impact on people’s daily lives because it can perform mundane and even complex activities more efficiently and effectively than humans. Although AI has many potential applications, it also raises important public policy questions, and more work needs to be done to create safe human-centred AI systems. While recognizing the progress made in the field of artificial intelligence, this review contributes to the ongoing conversation about how the law interacts with emerging technologies, what effect this has on society, and why it’s important to ensure openness, privacy, and protection of all parties that stand to benefit from these developments as the objectives. Human rights, democratic principles, and the risks of bringing one’s own prejudices into one’s digital interactions are among the most pressing concerns. Unlike humans, AI has no emotions or character of its own, hence it’s vital to highlight the bioethics of the arena of AI. However, contemporary AI has a huge effect on peoples’ daily lives and interpersonal interactions. To meet this new challenge, people need to think about and build new principles of AI bioethics to provide standards for AI technology to follow so that humanity can reap the benefits of AI advancements. Because of the unique challenges posed by these developing technologies, bioethical frameworks must be adapted to deal with them, and the development of these automated systems also needs to be tailored to incorporate bioethical principles. As AI develops, people will have to learn how to interact with something that isn’t human. However, now humans must contend with something that is also unnatural and unnaturally created: AI. Experts in the field of artificial intelligence were surveyed via the Delphi method to focus on the human rights and legal implications, bioethics of AI and how it is now being discussed, argued, addressed, and how human rights concepts are being impacted.","","978-1-6654-7607-2","10.1109/SLAAI-ICAI56923.2022.10002590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10002590","AI;social issues;legal issues;bioethics","Humanities;Privacy;Law;Pressing;Oral communication;Public policy;Artificial intelligence","","","","15","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation.

This evolution, however, is not without of moral consequences. Our increasingly AI-powered environment has elevated the need of considering the ethical implications of AI application in company strategy. Incorporating sophisticated fairness criteria, bias reduction strategies, transparency evaluations, and legal framework compliance, this study examines the varied terrain of AI ethics.The research shows that achieving justice and openness in AI systems requires constant juggling, with model accuracy typically taking a backseat. Concerns about potentially unfair AI-driven conclusions are met with effective solutions for bias reduction, such as reweighing and resampling. Improving AI model interpretability by feature-level transparency evaluation using SHAP values. Also, AI has been shown to be ethically and legally compliant, as shown by its high compliance ratings with legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s requirements.These results provide useful insights for corporate executives, legislators, and the general public as they pertain to using AI in an ethical manner. The full potential of AI may be realized by enterprises while maintaining ethical standards if the correct balance is struck between fairness and openness, investment is made in bias prevention, and regulatory compliance is encouraged. In this study, we focus on how artificial intelligence might be reimagined from its current state as a potentially biased and opaque planning tool to one that drives ethical excellence in corporate strategy.This study acts as a catalyst for change by advocating for ethical and responsible AI deployment, which in turn creates a climate in which judgments influenced by AI are more fair, open, and lawful. These findings will serve as a springboard for other studies and activities that will push for more ethical AI development and use in company strategy.","","979-8-3503-1920-0","10.1109/ICSES60034.2023.10465461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465461","Business Planning;Artificial Intelligence (AI);Transparency Assessment;SHAP Values;Interdisciplinary Collaboration;Explainable AI (XAI);Bias Mitigation;Ethical Considerations;Interpretability","Ethics;Law;Companies;Planning;Artificial intelligence;General Data Protection Regulation;Standards","","1","","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This exploratory study hypothesizes that enhancing the mental health of AI systems can mitigate energy consumption. By drawing parallels between AI challenges, such as attention scatter, computational dyscalculia, and overfitting-and human mental disorders, we seek to develop novel strategies for optimizing AI efficiency. We propose that incorporating psychiatric expertise during AI training and development could steer models towards more energy-efficient operations, potentially revolutionizing training methodologies in the forthcoming years. These AI-related issues contribute to operational inefficiencies, prompting frequent algorithmic adjustments and heightened computational resource demands. Improving the management of these challenges within AI could reduce errors and redundant processes, refine decision-making, and lessen the necessity for retraining. We assessed the environmental impact of Gen-AI, focusing on energy expenditures during training and inference phases. For instance, training models like GPT-3 reportedly consume approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours, with ongoing inference contributing to even higher emissions. We contend that enhancing AI mental health and utilizing algorithms such as CarbonMin-which allocate computational tasks to regions with lower carbon footprints-can significantly reduce emissions by an estimated 35% currently and up to 71% by 2035. Advancements in hardware and software efficiencies could further diminish the carbon footprint by as much as a thousandfold compared to traditional models. This preliminary research suggests that integrating psychiatric principles into AI development could optimize performance and substantially lower energy consumption and carbon emissions, unveiling new avenues for future investigation.","","978-88-87237-62-7","10.23919/AEIT63317.2024.10736831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10736831","Generative Artificial Intelligence;Energy Consumption;AI Mental Health;Training Energy Expenditures;Exploratory Study","Training;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Mental disorders;Collaboration;Mental health;Carbon dioxide;Inference algorithms;Artificial intelligence;Carbon footprint","","","","16","","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a recognition that AI offers immense potential for improving human well-being, which has been formulated at length from many perspectives, including the economic, social, psychological, developmental, and health perspectives. Critical questions with regards to these AI for well-being systems are, “What does success as far as employing AI to support human well-being look like?” and perhaps more importantly, “How do we inform system development processes to ensure the said success?” AI ethical frameworks and design guidelines have been formulated that address these questions by articulating some notion of successful or desired AI. Further, approaches such as participatory design, value-sensitive design, and goal-oriented requirements engineering aim to connect system development processes with high-level contextual concerns and non-functional softgoals. However, to establish the effectiveness of these instruments for informing AI for well-being solutions, it is necessary to have normative analysis and evaluation frameworks that recognize the innate complexity and multidimensionality of human well-being. This paper presents Herman Dooyeweerd's philosophy as one such framework and provides a formulation of well-being informed by his Theory of Aspects and his “simultaneous realization of norms” principle. The paper then presents a multi-aspectual analysis of AI Ethics frameworks to illustrate and suggest a mechanism that can be employed across diverse contexts and domains for requirement analysis and requirements refinement for technology solutions in general, but specifically for AI for well-being solutions.","","978-1-7281-8354-1","10.1109/REWBAH51211.2020.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216064","Multi-Aspectual Analysis;Requirements Analysis;Goal Analysis;Artificial Intelligence and Ethics;Well-being","Artificial intelligence;Economics;Psychology;Instruments;Complexity theory;Technological innovation;Extraterrestrial measurements","","3","","46","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

(CyCon),"4 Jul 2022","2022","700","","135","154","How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.","2325-5374","978-9916-9789-1-7","10.23919/CyCon55549.2022.9811076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811076","artificial intelligence;decision-making;cyber operations","Training;Decision making;Stakeholders;Artificial intelligence;Computer security","","3","","0","","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the applications of AI may not necessarily lead to a reduction in environmental pollution, as the outcomes may vary depending on the components of AI. The objective of this study is to examine the impacts of different components of artificial intelligence on environmental performance. To achieve this objective, the study utilises a panel regression model with a sample of 52 countries from the year 2019 to 2022. The seven sub-pillars considered for AI applications include commercial, development, government strategy, infrastructure, operating environment, research, and talent aspects. Additionally, this study investigates the impacts of different components of artificial intelligence on environmental performance in two groups of countries classified as advanced countries and developing countries. The results show that AI applications in development, government strategy, research, and the operating environment pillars are positive and significant for carbon emissions in all samples. Commercialisation in AI is negative and significant for carbon emissions in advanced countries. Infrastructure in AI is negative and significant for carbon emissions in developing countries. The implication of this study demonstrates that policies encouraging sustainable and responsible commercial AI development are effective in reducing the environmental impact in advanced countries. Developing countries, on the other hand, may benefit from policies that focus on building and enhancing AI infrastructure. The novelty of this study lies in the distinction between advanced and developing countries, allowing for tailored strategies to combat hazardous environments. Advanced countries may focus on managing the commercial aspects of AI, while developing countries may emphasise infrastructure development.","","979-8-3503-9427-6","10.1109/ICMRE60776.2024.10532166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10532166","artificial intelligence;carbon footprint;carbon emissions","Pollution;Mechatronics;Government;Green products;Finance;Carbon dioxide;Developing countries","","1","","18","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Big data mining has become the most fascinating and fastest growing area which enables the selection, exploring and modeling the vast amount of medical data to help clinical decision making, prevent medication error, and enhance patients' outcomes. Given the complexity and unstructured data nature in biomedicine, it was acknowledged that there is no single best data mining method for all applications. Indeed, an appropriate process and algorithm for big data mining is essential for obtaining a truthful result. Up to date, however, there is no guideline for this, especially about a fair sample size in the training set for reliable results. Sample size is of central importance because the biomedical data don't come cheap - they take time and human power to acquire the data and usually are very expensive. On the other hand, small sample size may result in the overestimates of the predictive accuracy by overfitting to the data. The purpose of this paper is to provide a guideline for determining the sample size that can result in a robust accuracy. Because the increment in data volume causes complexity and had a significant impact on the accuracy, we examined the relationship among sample size, data variation and performance of different data mining methods, including SVM, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and J48, by using simulation and two sets of biomedical data. The simulation result revealed that the sample size can dramatically affect the performance of data mining methods under a given data variation and this effect is most manifest in nonlinear case. For experimental biomedical data, it is essential to examine the impact of sample size and data variation on the performance in order to determine the sample size.","","978-1-5386-4342-6","10.1109/ICASI.2018.8394347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8394347","Big data mining;Artificial intelligence;Sample size;Guideline;Heterogeneous data","Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Big Data;Data models;Guidelines;Bioinformatics;Support vector machines","","","","18","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity.

AI is great for accelerating our work, but there are also downsides to it. One such downside is the application of Facial Recognition Technologies (FRT) available today, which has adverse consequences like racial discrimination or wrongful judgement by commercial firms and even law enforcement organizations. The landmark ‘Gender Shades’ project [1] in 2018 showed a highly skewed error bar between facial recognition accuracies of subjects who are black females compared to white males using an intersectional comparison approach between facial recognition software by IBM, Microsoft and Face++. This supplemented previous studies which highlighted issues with gender classification or on the whole misidentification issues posed by facial recognition technologies (FRT) [2]. This algorithm bias towards misgendering or misclassification based on skin color could be attributed to a highly unbalanced training datasets that lack diversity as well as a lack of understanding of the black box machine learning (ML) models that are used to build the FRTs. From a Code of Ethics perspective, such algorithms do not conform to the fundamental canons [3] such as prioritizing the safety, and welfare of the public. Furthermore, they cannot be used honorably, responsibly and ethically to enhance the reputation, and usefulness of the companies promoting these technologies because they are unable to provide truthful and objective information regarding facial recognition. A possible remedy could be to curate an exhaustively diverse dataset w.r.t both color and gender. However, the task of building such a dataset would require access to a diverse population, which is not always possible in a multi-racial and multi-ethnic society. We thus propose an exhaustive review-based study of existing work on the introduction of explainable AI [4],[5] (XAI) techniques in such ML models to understand how the model itself learns. This study would explore what constraints to put on the learning method of the model, which can enforce reduction in misclassification errors from gender and skin color thus enforcing various ethical aspects like taking care of algorithm bias, introducing transparency and accountability. It would also explore and underline the overall social impact improved FRTs might have from a code of ethics perspective.","2994-3531","979-8-3503-8514-4","10.1109/SIEDS61124.2024.10534745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534745","","Training;Ethics;Explainable AI;Face recognition;Sociology;Color;Oral communication","","","","18","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the research articles were categorized according to the artificial intelligence methods applied such as machine learning, expert systems, decision support system, optimization, and image recognition and computer vision. Second, the articles were categorized based on supply chain stages targeted such as design, fabric production, apparel production, and distribution. In addition, the supply chain stages were further classified based on business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) to give a broader outlook of the industry. As a result of the categorizations, research gaps were identified in the applications of AI techniques, at the supply chain stages and from a business (B2B/B2C) perspective. Based on these gaps, the future prospects of the AI in this domain are discussed. These can benefit the researchers in academics and industrial practitioners working in the domain of the fashion and apparel industry.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928979","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763948","Artificial intelligence;big data analytics;machine learning;expert systems;fashion and apparel industry","Industries;Supply chains;Databases;Machine learning;Textiles","","66","","205","CCBY","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior innovation research has mainly focused on the opportunities for and challenges to infusing digital technologies into the innovation process. However, understanding the general effects of digital technologies is insufficient as their specific fields of application differ. AI is distinct from other digital technologies, given its potential to evolve into both a general-purpose technology and a method of inventing, and several firms are beginning to integrate AI into their innovation processes. We capture this phenomenon by introducing a concept we term self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI), defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products, based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources. As SAI is about to fundamentally change how innovations are created, this article describes the underlying AI technology; conceptualizes and outlines how firms may incorporate SAI into their innovation processes with the aim of developing increasingly complex products; and offers potential avenues for further research in this intriguing domain.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.2977222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036086","Artificial intelligence (AI);digitization;inno-vation process;product innovation;self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI)","Artificial intelligence;Technological innovation;Big Data;Innovation management;Computer science;Decision making;Organizations","","49","","128","IEEE","13 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The impact angle constraint problem between the missile and the target is transformed into a line-of-sight angle constraint problem. A reward function is designed based on the relative motion status of the missile and target during the guidance process and the desired line-of-sight angle error to guide the interception missile to hit the target while satisfying the impact angle constraint. Finally, a SAC bias proportional navigation law (SACBPN) is obtained by training the reinforcement learning agent. Numerical simulations are conducted under both steady motion and maneuvering conditions of the target. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning guidance law SACBPN is significantly superior to the bias proportional navigation law (BPN), effectively reducing the miss distance and impact angle error at the moment of impact. This indicates that the proposed guidance method is more suitable for intercepting moving targets in aerodynamic environments.","1934-1768","978-9-8875-8158-1","10.23919/CCC63176.2024.10661814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10661814","Deep Reinforcement Learning;Soft Actor-Critic;Biased Proportional Navigation;impact Angle Constraint","Training;Missiles;Monte Carlo methods;Navigation;Heuristic algorithms;Line-of-sight propagation;Aerodynamics","","","","20","","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As with every technological advance, the uptake phase of AI is the ideal time to improve the governance, cybersecurity and safety of these systems. The cybersecurity risks in AI systems are similar to the ones in other information technology systems. However, the regulation of AI systems is changing, so new governance tools are needed. Furthermore, the safety and societal impact of AI depends on the technological choices made when building the systems (e.g., biased training data, overfitted machine learning models, model poisoning attacks or needlessly computation-heavy algorithms). AI tools built with large language model technology seem to speak our languages and therefore appear deceptively easy to adopt. The goal of our research is to provide risk management tools that are similarly easy to use, even if they later lead the adopter into setting up a full technical quality management system.

In this scenario, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support physicians in the decision-making process. However, AI provides a probability that an event will happen, without information regarding how to reduce such probability. EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, allow to better understand how the score is computed but still lack in providing specific suggestions. We propose a method that creates a set of actionable suggestions on how to change the feature values to reduce a risk predicted by AI, and support the physicians in deciding when to discharge a patient. We utilize historical data distribution of features to understand how values for the current case should be modified. After retrieving a set of relevant historical data by considering the similarity with the current point, we use statistical analysis to highlight differences between the feature values of current and historical cases. A suggestion is made whenever a significative difference on a controllable feature is found. For the evaluation, we used an electronic health record (MIMIC-III) to produce suggestions to reduce 30 days rehospitalization probability. A ground truth set of suggestions was created for 54 patients, by considering how changes in feature values affected the risk, as well as if feature values fell within literature ranges. The proposed approach reached a precision of 80%. The adoption of this method will allow to decrease costs related to rehospitalizations and positively impact patients’ health.","2375-9356","978-1-6654-7578-5","10.1109/BigComp57234.2023.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066585","Artificial Intelligence;Actionable Suggestions;Risk Reduction;MIMIC-III","Costs;Statistical analysis;Hospitals;MIMICs;Decision making;Probability;Big Data","","1","","14","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technology makes a greater impact on student’s life in helping parents and teachers understand and realize their panic situations. Several students are losing lives due to unbearable panic attacks and tough decisions they make due to their panic phase. In the current education system, many students face panic due to fear of exams, failure in exams, bullying, and so on. If this situation is recognized at its initial stage, it can help the guardians to save them from any dangerous decisions or situations. The AI can play a major role in monitoring the day-to-day activities by identifying their panic and alerting the responsible person. This is achieved by monitoring facial expressions and human behavioral patterns. The AI system also equips their mind by providing the counseled content on their mobile phones provided by professional counselors to soothe their minds and avoid harsh thoughts. As the AI system is made to control within a private network to enhance privacy, the choice of alerting personal and counseling options can be availed by their parents. This Artificial Intelligence technology-based system not only saves students from panic but also promotes a positive personality.

In order to solve this problem, this article has optimized the intelligent speech recognition system from the following aspects: one is the optimization of speech signal processing; the second is the optimization of speech signal feature extraction; the third is the optimization of speech recognition accuracy. Finally, a translator speech recognition method was designed to implement the construction of an English translator speech recognition system. The system performance test results show that the speech recognition method of uploading audio has a good recognition effect, with an accuracy rate of 96.7%. Therefore, the English translator speech intelligent recognition system designed in this article has achieved good functional testing results and meets practical needs. From the results, the voice recognition method of uploading audio is better than the direct speaking method. This may be because the audio is uploaded in a way that avoids the impact of ambient noise on speech recognition. In the functional test of speech synthesis, the system can quickly generate accurate speech and obtain good results. This shows that the English translation speech recognition system based on artificial intelligence algorithm performs well in speech generation.","","979-8-3503-0082-6","10.1109/NMITCON58196.2023.10276003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10276003","English translator;speech recognition;artificial intelligence algorithms;deep neural network","System performance;Multimedia systems;Signal processing algorithms;Speech recognition;Signal processing;Speech synthesis;Artificial intelligence","","","","20","IEEE","17 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This partiality, if left un-monitored, can pose a risk to the safety of those in need of disaster relief. typically manifests into inaccuracies in the decision-making processes and if not carefully monitored can cause larger issues. This paper extends the knowledge presented in a previous work, which presents the design and modeling of search and rescue operations using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. The search and rescue operations using UAV swarms (SAROUS) model is modernized by introducing artificial intelligence to the operation framework that ideally will reduce the operator workload. The results suggest that a trade-off exists between operator fatigue, task correctness, and operation timeliness. This is due to the amount of work generated and needing to be processed manually by the operator rather than automatically by an AI algorithm. Both the operator and AI contribute to some level of error when processing tasks, which influence the overall effectiveness of the operation. The performance of the operator and swarm is estimated under this new operation design and the dynamic of the human-robot interaction is analyzed. 11Research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-22-2-0199.

To facilitate the time-to-go estimation, the whole guidance process is divided into two stages. The sliding mode guidance law based on the constant reaching law is designed for the first stage and the proportional guidance law is utilized in the second stage. By choosing the sliding mode variable appropriately, not only an attack with a small miss distance but also a prescribed impact angle can be achieved. According to the feature of the constant reaching law, the time-to-go estimation for the first stage can be established easily. To obtain the time-to-go of the second stage, the estimated look-ahead angle and range at the switching point between the first stage and second stage are calculated. Further, the time-to-go estimation of the second stage is obtained according to the trajectory shape of the missile steered by the proportional guidance law. In the second stage, rather than the estimated look-ahead angle and range but the current look-ahead angle and range are used to calculate the time-to-go.

Firstly, component-based software architecture and component interaction trace are defined. An algorithm for generating component interaction trace from static structure model of software architecture and UML sequence diagram is provided. Secondly, the taxonomy of changes on composition-based software architecture is presented, according to which a set of impact rules are suggested to determine the transfer of the changes in component and among components.

While AI systems and concerns for their ethical operation are not new, the scale of impact and adoption of AI systems in legal practice makes consideration of the ethics of these systems timely. While there has been recent progress in development of ethical guidelines for AI systems, much of this is targeted at the developers of these systems in general, or the actions of these AI systems as autonomous entities, rather than in the legal practice context. Much of the ethical guidance - whether for AI systems or legal professional is captured in high level principles within more narrowly defined domains, more specific guidance may be appropriate to identify and assess ethical risks.

Artificial intelligence could automate this task making the diagnosis more accessible. Still, it needs a large amount of annotated training data coming from experts.In this work, we proposed the use of crowdsourced annotated medical images to train AI models (neural networks) for the detection of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in microscopy images from stool samples leveraging non-expert knowledge collected through playing a video game. We collected annotations made by both school-age children and adults, and we showed that, although the quality of crowdsourced annotations made by school-age children are sightly inferior than the ones made by adults, AI models trained on these crowdsourced annotations perform similarly (AUC of 0.928 and 0.939 respectively), and reach similar performance to the AI model trained on expert annotations (AUC of 0.932). We also showed the impact of the training sample size and continuous training on the performance of the AI models.In conclusion, the workflow proposed in this work combined collective and artificial intelligence for detecting soil-transmitted helminthiasis.

To address these limitations, neuro-symbolic AI has been emerged as a new AI field that combines efficiency of “sub-symbolic” AI with the assurance and transparency of “symbolic” AI. Furthermore, AI (that suffers from aforementioned challenges) will remain inadequate for operating independently in contested, unpredictable and complex multi-domain battlefield (MDB) environment for the foreseeable future and the AI enabled autonomous systems will require human in the loop to complete the mission in such a contested environment. Moreover, in order to successfully integrate AI enabled autonomous systems into military operations, military operators need to have assurance that these systems will perform as expected and in a safe manner.

It all started with industrial revolution wave and automation. Slowly the impact of computers and other gadgets was severely felt. However, the impact that artificial intelligence has brought in, seems to be incomparable and indeterminate too. Human beings have been the providers of service at every point in the block chain. However, the replacement of humans by machines is not new. The issuing of pink slips and downsizing the organization is also a trend witnessed in due to many reasons, including digitalization. This research paper is an attempt to understand the role of people in organization amidst the confusion of who holds the absolute answerability. On the plain note, humans are answerable to any reservations that arise in organizations. But in this era where machines are becoming intellect, are we still playing the blame game on humans towards answerability? HR analytics have come up in a big way and analytical thinking as well as predictions are the prime armaments in the hands of an accomplished HR. When the scenario is changing in this direction, the workforce itself is changing and becoming dynamic. Decision making is facilitated by algorithms and the human interface is on a decline. In this scenario, the absolute answerability which was with the human force, till late is now in a quandary. The objective of the paper is to access the role of AI in the era of deep learning and the impact it has on the HR trends. The talent (workforce) component has to be not only managed but has to be molded in such a way that they exceed their performance when compared to machines. The creativity part has to be creatively enhanced. In doing so, the question is, will AI take a back seat or will it lead to a complete conquer of human resources in organizations.

Inputs and outputs specification of each function can be specified in terms of input and output names, input and output data types, as well as input and output constraints. Inputs and outputs of each function may be related and not related to database schema. Thus, when changes of inputs or outputs of a function that are related to database schema are occurred, the database schema and test cases of the function will be affected. This paper proposes an approach to analyze impact to test cases for changing inputs or outputs of functional requirements. Our approach offers change process to control changes over functional requirements, test cases, and database schema. The approach also enables rollback facility that allows cancelling of changes.","","978-1-7281-1651-8","10.1109/SNPD.2019.8935754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935754","Impact analysis;Functional requirements;Changes;Test cases","Databases;Web services;Testing;Process control;History;Maintenance engineering","","4","","8","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By comparing historical market data during two notable periods of financial distress—the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 market downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic—against the backdrop of predictions made by AI models devoid of emotional biases, this research illuminates the potential of AI to instill a level of rationality in trading decisions that is often compromised by human emotions such as fear and greed. Through a meticulous analysis employing various sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms, the findings distinctly highlight that AI possesses the ability not only to predict market trends with a high degree of accuracy but also to suggest that a market guided by AI-driven decisions could potentially experience reduced volatility and shallower downturns. These insights point to a promising future where AI could serve as an invaluable tool for investors, potentially leading to more stable markets and improved financial outcomes. However, the integration of AI into the financial decision-making process raises important ethical considerations and necessitates the development of robust regulatory frameworks to manage the systemic risks associated with widespread automation.

Incidents of serious damage due to DDoS attacks have been increasing, thereby leading to an urgent need for new attack identification, mitigation, and prevention mechanisms. To prevent DDoS attacks, the basic features of the attacks need to be dynamically analyzed because their patterns, ports, and protocols or operation mechanisms are rapidly changed and manipulated. Most of the proposed DDoS defense methods have different types of drawbacks and limitations. Some of these methods have signature-based defense mechanisms that fail to identify new attacks and others have anomaly-based defense mechanisms that are limited to specific types of DDoS attacks and yet to be applied in open environments. Subsequently, extensive research on applying artificial intelligence and statistical techniques in the defense methods has been conducted in order to identify, mitigate, and prevent these attacks. However, the most appropriate and effective defense features, mechanisms, techniques, and methods for handling such attacks remain to be an open question.

They will continue to increase in ubiquity and impact for some time to come. In conjunction with this increase, many scholars have studied the nature of these impacts, including problems of fairness. Here, fairness refers to conflicts of interest between social groups that result from the configuration of these AI systems. One focus of research has been to define these fairness problems and to quantify them in a way that lends itself to calculation of fair outcomes. The purpose of this presentation is to show that this issue of fairness in AI is consistent with fairness problems posed by technological design in general and that addressing these problems goes beyond what can be readily quantified and calculated. For example, many such problems may be best resolved by forms of public consultation. This point is clarified by presenting an analytical tool, the Fairness Impact Assessment, and examples from AI and elsewhere.","2158-3412","978-1-6654-3580-2","10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629140","Artificial intelligence;fairness;design;technology assessment","Social groups;Tools;Artificial intelligence","","","","0","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regeneration teamspsila inability to manually analyze complex maps for various regeneration choices induces human errors in the regeneration process. This often results in a prolonged impact on the economic, social and environmental wellbeing and sustainability of the region. This paper, presents the development of an urban regeneration fuzzy inference system (FIS) aimed at tackling the issue of regeneration simulation in built environment through the measurement of impact of certain socioeconomic parameters to the regeneration plan. The impact assessment logic is embedded in the form of an expertly guided rule-base of an FIS. The impact is calculated using the four core principles of urban smart growth (crime, accessibility, employment and health), with respect to a measure of Euclidean intra-regional distance based accessibility function between the regeneration area(s) and the surrounding built environment neighborhood.

The traditional methodologies of R&D have seen a massive revolution through the entry of AI, which now poses uncharted capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. The application is able to thoroughly search vast sets of data in an unrealistically short period, so as to reveal latent structures, patterns, and other actionable insights, with the help of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing techniques. This paradigm shift in R&D supports a more agile, data-driven approach to scientific inquiry that allows researchers to better focus their efforts with precision and alacrity on the most vexing, complex problems. The biggest gain to be reaped from infusing $A I$ in R&D is the hastening of the pace of experimentation and hypothesis testing. AI systems thus enable researchers to iterate very quickly by automating repetitive tasks and offering the best designs for experimentation.

In a nutshell, the developed assessment methodology consists in two stages: (1) an open-ended survey that collects the contextual information and the technical features, in order to properly identify potential threats for FR, and (2) a quantitative matrix that measures the potential impacts of the AI system on each right safeguarded by the European Charter of Fundamentals Rights with a traceable and robust procedure.

Among them, one of the most discussed is the virtual agent ChatGPT. This chatbot may occasionally produce fake information, as also declared by the producer OpenAI. Such a model may provide very useful support in several tasks, ranging from text summarization to programming. The research community has marginally investigated the impact that fake information created by AI models has on the users’ perceptions and on their belief in AI. We analyzed the impact of the fake information produced by AI on user perceptions, specifically trust and satisfaction, by performing a user study on ChatGPT. An additional issue is assessing whether the early or late knowledge of the possibility of the tool generating fake information has a different impact on the users’ perceptions. We conducted an experiment, involving 62 university students, a category of users who may employ tools such as ChatGPT extensively. The experiment consisted of a guided interaction with ChatGPT. Some of the participants experienced the failure of the chatbot, while a control group only received correct and reliable answers. We collected participants’ perceptions of trust, satisfaction, and usability, together with the net promoter score (NPS). The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in trust and satisfaction between the users who early experienced fake information production compared to those who discovered ChatGPT’s faulty behaviors later during the interaction. Also, there is no statistically significant difference among the users who received the late fake information and the control group (no fake information). Usability and the NPS also resulted higher when the fake news was detected in the late interaction. When users are aware of the fake information generated by ChatGPT their trust and satisfaction decrease, especially when they impact on this at the early stage of use of the chatbot. Nevertheless, the perception of trust and satisfaction still remains high, as some of the users are still enthusiastic; others consider a more conscious use of the tool in terms of support to be verified. A useful strategy could be to favor a critical use of ChatGPT, letting young people to verify the provided information. This should be a new way to perform learning activities.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3291539","National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR)–Italian Ministry of University and Research(grant numbers:PE0000013-FAIR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183726","Believe artificial intelligence (AI);ChatGPT;controlled experiment;fake information;trust in AI","Chatbots;Artificial intelligence;Reliability;Usability;Ethics;Trajectory;Fake news;Trust management","","10","","30","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It offers personalized student learning, support to academic and professional staff, and the streamlining administrative tasks. This rapidly developing technology promises to significantly influence the higher educational landscape. An interpretive synthesis of the current application of conversational artificial intelligence in higher education was guided by a state-of-the-art literature review. The aim of the research study was to evaluate academics perspective of conversational AI use and its perceived benefits and challenges, in four different countries (South Africa, Hungary, Lebanon, and Wales). It was found that less than half of the respondents employed conversational AI in teaching, whereas most of the respondents utilized it for research support. The preference for using conversational artificial intelligence tools in research rather than in teaching—particularly among younger academics and those favoring remote working environments—suggests a future trajectory where AI could become more central in academic research than in traditional teaching methods. Furthermore, it was found that significantly more of those who do not use conversational AI for teaching, prefer teaching face to face, whereas those using conversational AI to enhance their teaching, most were neutral about their preferred mode of delivery. Despite some of the concerns raised by some academics, most viewed it its numerous potential advantages for teaching and research, positively.

The purpose of this research is focusing on the impact of service quality for automotive aftermarket parts and customers' willingness to repurchase. In this study, 400 questionnaire invitations through e-mail were distributed to existing customers and 164 valid questionnaires were responded. The responded answers were encoded, filed, and verified using SPSS. Degree and validity analysis, narrative statistics, single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied for analysis. Through empirical analysis, there are many findings: Sales Service & Marketing, R&D capabilities, and innovative services in service quality are positively and significantly related to customers' willingness to repurchase. In the single factor variation analysis and structural equations, it is found that the impact of customer type on service quality and customer repurchase intention is not significantly related. In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was also applied to compare the impact of service quality and to build the prediction model for customer repurchasing. These AI techniques include decision tree, neural network models, and multiple-linear regression. It is concluded that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have better predictive ability after training with sufficient data and proper input data. For decision tree and regression analysis, these models' predicting power will decrease when the data becomes more complex.","","978-1-6654-2318-2","10.1109/IMCOM51814.2021.9377415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377415","SERVQUAL;Service quality;PZB Model;ANN;Decision tree;Multiple Linear Regression;ID3 Algorithm","Analytical models;Companies;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Artificial intelligence;Research and development;Automotive engineering","","2","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Urbanization helps a nation's economy develop and flourish. Urbanization refers to the spread of a city or suburb into its environs. The growth of cities indicates a country's economic well-being since cities are major financial hubs. Employment opportunities increase, and the local economy benefits as a metropolitan area expands. Demand for products and services rises due to urbanization, prompting a reallocation of resources (land, labor, and capital) from agriculture to other sectors of the economy. Cities have increasing needs, exacerbated by poor air and water quality, limited water supply, waste-disposal worries, and excessive energy usage. Economic expansion is impossible without technological progress, which makes it possible to mass-produce better goods at reduced prices. Effective city planning will be crucial for addressing these, and other challenges as the world's urban centers grow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already had a wide-ranging impact on our culture, and its influence on our daily lives and the economy is only growing. The research suggests that an AI-EGF might be a valuable tool for increasing the prosperity of urban areas. Some people believe that AI can help the economy develop and increase productivity. Analysis of large data sets may be performed effectively to raise productivity and standard of living. When a new product, market, or industry is created, consumer demand increases and new revenue opportunities arise. Recent years have seen a rise in the urgency of concerns about the impact of AI on organizations and consumers.

The way in which the system learns to take decision differs in each system. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to aid users to take decisions depending upon previous decisions taken by the same or a different user. The system stores the decisions taken by user p1 under a given scenario for a particular situation. Later on when user p2 needs to take a decision, the system mines for similar situations faced by p1 and assigns weight to them, followed by calculation of priorities of p2's scenario. Next, standard deviation and priorities of p1's situation(s) in comparison to p2's situation is done. This is followed by finding out impact factor of each of p1's situation(s). Finally using impact factors an impact matrix is derived which shows the decisions that p2 can take. This algorithm has wide range of applications such as the banking sector. The results shown in this paper illustrate how the algorithm is implemented.","","978-1-4799-6908-1","10.1109/IEMCON.2015.7344531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344531","Intelligent Systems;Artificial Intelligence;Relative Decision Taking;Cognitive Computing;Situation and Scenario Prioritization;Impact Factor;Impact Matrix","Intelligent systems;Decision support systems;Meteorology;Expert systems;Artificial neural networks;Decision making","","","","19","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accounting for these characteristics in real-world practice is challenging in aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis (AS) as they impact individualized decisions in achieving meaningful postprocedural outcomes without excessive risk. Based on these characteristics, 864 unique scenarios were created that formed the original dataset, which was further split into 70% training and 30% testing datasets. More controversial clinical scenarios were further tuned based on responses from ten cardiologists and processed using multilayered neural network sequential features analysis and deep learning methods. Contrary to guidelines, symptoms and left ventricular function ranked low in physician importance. In contrast, aging-related functional features, including cognition, ambulation, and frailty scores, ranked high with good overall model accuracy (Shapley 0.811, TabNet 0.938). Feature optimization using the top three features showed good model accuracy (Shapley 0.811, TabNet 0.881).

POE-LIFE is a developed app to be used as a platform for students to express their emotions through poems, it is also completed with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) function to help students with their poems. The objectives are to know the contributions of POE-LIFE in helping students manage their sadness and anger, to discover the reason(s) behind student’s comfortableness in using AI or not using AI when they are writing poems in POE-LIFE, and to find out the reason of the loss of authenticity when students use AI’s help when writing the poems. The methods used are qualitative and quantitative research methods by analyzing the reasons provided by the participants through the surveys as well as measuring the number of students picking certain answers. The results are that POE-LIFE did help students relieved their emotions, but it is not enough; Most students are quite comfortable in using AI as it can provide ideas for them, but there are still some who did not like to use AI in making poem; and AI did somehow make some students feel like they lose their authenticity if they used the ideas provided by the AI.","","979-8-3503-6664-8","10.1109/iSemantic63362.2024.10762099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10762099","psychology;emotion;Artificial Intelligence;authenticity;therapy","Surveys;Seminars;Atmospheric measurements;Medical treatment;Mental health;Writing;Particle measurements;Complexity theory;Logic;Artificial intelligence","","","","7","IEEE","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also a common practice presently being done, especially in terms of recruitment, to collect huge amounts of data for application identification, applicant profiles' analysis, interviews, selection of the most appropriate potential among many others. This makes its impact on human resource function, perception of prospective employees, firm's cultures, and policies. This situation is problematic, and it is associated with reality for several reasons, which could be either due to lack of awareness by the recruiter or early adaptors who have started the implementation process on adoption curve model. It drives us to learn more and educate people concerning the possible uses of this technology. The A.I. optimizes the experience for the applicants because the HR manager does not have to spend much time on the procedure. This allows the company to save these resources and use them to boost its output. In fact, a study done by the Sage group shows that more than 24% of companies across the world use AI for interviews and job evaluation. A majority of over two-thirds of HRM's is willing to adopt AI within one year. The World Economic Forum (W.E.F.) has projected that about seventy-five million out of the current workforce positions will disappear. The H.R. will be stressed by the addition of a hundred and thirteen million new jobs opportunities and positions. Especially, as there is the onset of AI and ML in organizations; they will lead to hiring additional H.R. experts to address the extra workloads.","","979-8-3503-7647-0","10.1109/INNOCOMP63224.2024.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664096","Artificial Intelligence;Employment Progression;Talent Acquisition;And Human Resource","Industries;Technological innovation;Leadership;Automation;Costs;Profitability;Companies","","","","20","IEEE","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of the resource-based view, emerging technologies can form critical organizational resources to manage these EW-induced risks effectively. Therefore, this article focuses on EW-induced supply chain risks and how artificial intelligence (AI) helps to mitigate them. First, a cognitive mapping approach is used to identify EW-induced risks, their direct links, EW occurrences, and AI capabilities that might mitigate their negative impacts. Second, the best-worst method (BWM) is adopted to rank these EW-induced risks. BWM results suggest that EW-induced risks are prominent in the midstream supply chain, followed by upstream and downstream. EW-induced transportation, farm, and demand risks are the most prevalent of the 11 risk factors, while psychological stress, market share risk, and customer dissatisfaction are the least prominent. This finding reveals that although the EW-induced risks have the greatest impact on local firms, they will be transferred to upstream and downstream firms. Furthermore, a data requirement-based evaluation of AI algorithms and a conceptual framework are developed for a systematic approach to selecting and designing an AI system for managing EW-induced supply chain risks. This study empirically discloses the multilevel relationships between AI capabilities and EW-induced supply chain risks, which can help supply chain professionals effectively manage EW-induced risks through AI.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2023.3289258","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72072021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10188402","Artificial intelligence (AI);cocoa supply chain;cognitive mapping;extreme weather;supply chain mapping","Supply chains;Artificial intelligence;Organizations;Production;Meteorology;Droughts;Africa","","5","","68","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AI is a field of research that deals with the simulation of human intelligence processes using machines and computer systems. Many industries within the manufacturing, energy, construction, aerospace, transport, and healthcare sectors are adopting AI technologies and advanced data analytics tools with the goal to improve their business performance and user experience. Despite some success stories, numerous surveys report that many industries have been slow or failed to adopt AI beyond the proof-of-concept phase to the enterprise scale. This study aims to explore the drivers and barriers to the adoption of AI, and then assess the readiness of industries in implementing AI and big data technologies within their organizations. To gather industry's views on AI and its impact on business models and customer relationships, a close-ended questionnaire is designed and distributed to the respondents. A strategic analysis using the SWOT method is performed to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that may face industries during the AI implementation process. The major challenges identified include the lack of access to IT infrastructure and skilled AI talent; lack of good quality data; weak business cases; and complications around policies, regulations, and ethics. To examine the maturity of industries in adopting AI technologies, we used the NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) metric, that is based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 1 being the least mature and 9 being the most mature technology. A large majority of respondents have indicated that their TRL in terms of AI infrastructure is between 3 and 4, whereas the TRL in terms of software platforms lies between 3 and 6. Finally, some recommendations are made to help industries overcome challenges in moving to a higher TRL scale.","","979-8-3503-3585-9","10.1109/ICAC57885.2023.10275230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10275230","Artificial Intelligence (AI);Industry 4.0;SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats);Technology Readiness Level (TRL)","Industries;Measurement;NASA;Organizations;Regulation;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Artificial intelligence","","2","","17","IEEE","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Food retail stands out amongst the most affected sectors. New technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), lead to the emergence of a new retail concept, Smart Retailing, bringing benefits, not only for the retailer, but also for the consumer. In addition, they impact the jobs, in particular, store assistants’ job. Despite the growing academic interest in these topics, the acceptance and impact of AI-based solutions on store assistants is scarcely studied. This work aims, therefore, to study the acceptance and perception of AI-based solutions by store assistants in food retail. Qualitative research was performed, having carried out 20 interviews with food retail store assistants that already work with AI-based solutions. Results show that store assistants are aware of what AI is and in which solutions it is used. They perceive these solutions as being beneficial for the performance of their duties, complementing their work instead of replacing them. They are willing to use these solutions and perceive them as being easy and intuitive to use. This study contributes with a starting point for future research on the topic.","2693-8855","979-8-3503-1517-2","10.1109/ICE/ITMC58018.2023.10332368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10332368","Smart Retailing;Artificial Intelligence;Technology Acceptance;Food Retail;Store Assistants","Training;Productivity;Technological innovation;Engineering profession;Sociology;Companies;Teamwork","","","","43","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies and tests show that AI can deliver identical or better prognoses, diagnoses, and surgical outcomes than medical professionals. Healthcare sectors are adopting AI, and its applications are reforming it by reducing expenditure and exceeding patient satisfaction. The dearth of AI advocacy and adoption has forfeited large annual opportunity costs for the health industry and artificial intelligence engineers (AIE). There is a shortage of studies using quantitative models to test the barrier interrelationship and its effect on AI adoption, especially from the perspective of a developing country like India. Therefore, this study explores the barriers to adopting AI in healthcare in India. A total of 250 barriers related to technology adoption are determined after thoroughly analyzing previous studies and several focus group discussions (FGDs). Barriers are reduced to 16 most relevant barriers through multiple Healthcare expert FGDs and the DELPHI method. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and crossimpact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) are the analytical techniques used to classify the barriers into different impact levels and importance. The derived outcomes from the ISM and MICMAC methods illustrate that the unavailability of infrastructure and policy support and AI's potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities are the predominant problems for AI adoption in healthcare. The outcome is proposed to add to the theory of technology adoption, which facilitates the organizations in selecting the technology and opening the path for its spread and use by healthcare stakeholders.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2024.3386580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10495137","Artificial intelligence (AI);barrier;DELPHI;healthcare;interpretive structural modeling (ISM)–crossimpact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC)","Artificial intelligence;Medical services;Industries;Decision making;Robots;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pandemics","","5","","109","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the electronics sector, where products undergo rapid technological advancements and complex supply chains, LCA plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability and guiding decision-making processes. On the one hand, the environmental sustainability of electronics like ICT, Consumer Electronics, micro-electronics and Network Equipment is affected by the huge missing data because of the complexity, variety, large number of components, and otherwise different suppliers around the world. A more accurate, reliable, and standard LCA data management is necessary to decrease risks in the Supply Chain, increase transparency and provide sustainable and circular Business Models for Electronic Products and ICT Services. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly the advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to disruptive innovations in data modeling and other fields. To address this issue in the electronic industry, the integration of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) can transform precision assessment from data inventory to automated LCA modeling, and innovative methodologies for a cost-efficient data configuration. We provide a comprehensive overview of advances in the application of big data and AI technologies for LCA of electronics. We discuss key challenges in missing data and utilization for electronics and micro-electronics, offering strategic solutions. This novel AI-data approach helps organizations easily provide the missing data by integrating complex and disparate data sources across multiple distributed sources to give insights.

A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283137","","Measurement;Navigation;Government;Public policy;Artificial intelligence;System implementation;Testing","","5","","78","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the literature has focused on specific markets and algorithms so far, but it is unclear what happens across algorithms and markets. To analyze the business and economic impact of pricing algorithms, we build a computational model that considers two sophisticated AI algorithms (Q-learning and Particle Swarm Optimization) competing in prices in three different market structures (Logit, Hotelling, and linear demand models). From a social perspective, we find that PSO outperforms Q-learning, which tends to set supracompetitive prices. However, small changes in the algorithm designs may drive them to set more competitive prices, implying that a proper analysis of algorithmic competition requires considering the details of the algorithms and the market structure. When firms compete on algorithms, algorithms may generate price dispersion. Additionally, when facing a traditional competitor that uses a best-response function, algorithms tend to set supracompetitive prices, and both firms earn extra profits, but the traditional competitor benefits the most.

Nevertheless, we still feel that many of the suggestions present in our article, which would help to operationalize the regulation, are not addressed. One example is the reduced scope of the regulation to a list of “high risk applications,” leaving without a legal framework all other AI applications. We believe that the principles that inspire the regulation should also be applied in “lower risk applications.” Defining only the compliance process for AI developers, but leaving open the specific technical requirements that these high risk applications shall meet leaves untouched the existing gap between legal language and engineering practice. There are no described mechanisms by which all stakeholders (other than developers and implementers) can influence AI development, monitor their performance or claim redress if harmed. These shortcomings and other issues presented in our article leave the door open to loopholes that we hope the European Parliament can fix during the legislative process.","1937-416X","","10.1109/MTS.2021.3056284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445794","","Technical requirements;Law;Europe;Regulation;Stakeholders;Human factors;Artificial intelligence","","8","","29","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this article, we aim to bridge the gap by examining an integrated framework of factors conceptually assumed to enable SCRe improvement. Grounded in information processing theory and dynamic capabilities view perspective, conceptually, AI has a relationship with SCRe; simultaneously, dynamic capabilities (DCs) mediate this relationship, and open innovation (OI) moderates the influence of AI on DC. The findings of this study suggest that, in the face of disruption and an uncertain environment, AI is a strategic tool for firms to improve DC and, ultimately, SCRe. Additionally, OI plays a moderation role in the impact of AI on DC.

However, in this context, it is not only the students who are confronted with a new topic, but also their teachers. The vast majority of CS teachers have not dealt with AI during their studies and are, therefore, facing a stiff challenge when it comes to teaching it. Consequently, there is an unquestionable need for professional development for teachers in the field of artificial intelligence.Following the strategy of the Professional Development for CS Principles (PD4CS) initiative, a broad characterization of the content knowledge related to the respective topic is necessary as a first step. For this reason, semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers with different levels of experience and varying previous knowledge of Computer Science to find out what pre-concepts about AI teachers would bring into a PD program. Based on this, together with a body of knowledge gathered from experts and reference books in artificial intelligence, the necessary AI content knowledge of the teachers is defined.The semi-structured interviews were analyzed using a qualitative approach based on the text analysis of Mayring. To respond to low intercoder-agreement, we used an approach described by Campbell and Quincy.Investigations of previous knowledge in programming show that this knowledge has a significant impact on misconceptions found with the participants. Bonar and Soloway identified gaps in previous knowledge as one reason for this. Our findings point to a similar effect of previous knowledge in the field of AI. This poses a problem as our participants are teachers who will be AI instructors themselves and who might pass on certain misconceptions to their students. Consequently, the accurate identification and description of the teachers' knowledge gaps is an important starting point for providing a suitable and successful professional development program.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274136","Artificial Intelligence;K-12 CS Education;Professional Development for Teachers","Education;Artificial intelligence;Planning;Training;Interviews;Programming profession;Tools","","19","","29","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key challenge in current research is the complexity of interpreting the measured signals and delivering appropriate interventions, currently no miniaturised closed-loop DBS device has on-board artificial intelligence (AI) to meet this need. This paper presents a new miniaturised device, named SmartStim, that uses AI to monitor dynamically changing brain biomarkers. In addition, the AI decides if the output stimulator is required for treatment. This device has two key components: the hardware module (neural sensor unit, processor, and neurostimulator) and a software module (data processing, AI, and firmware). The neural sensor unit is comprised of two subcomponents. The first is a potentiostat that can perform impedance analysis, and the second is a dedicated fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) front-end that can perform scan rates up to 1000 V/s. This device can output current-controlled stimulation waveforms in a frequency range of 5 Hz – 200 Hz, a current range of  $1~\mu \text{A}$  to 10 mA, with active charge balancing.

The concurrent rapid growth in artificial intelligence, computation power and the infrastructure needed for communication and storage raises concerns that important issues of sustainable, ethical development and societal impact are not considered fully. Computing systems are having an increasingly negative impact on the environment, and yet they also are perhaps the key to unlocking huge improvements in sustainability. This paper evaluates the learning from a module delivered to Computing Technologies students at Ulster University. The rationale was that appraisal of ethics and its role in artificial intelligence will empower students, as future practitioners, to promote sustainability in the workplace.","2688-1454","979-8-3503-5298-6","10.1109/ISSC61953.2024.10603347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10603347","computing;education;sustainability;ethics;artificial intelligence","Productivity;Green energy;Computers;Ethics;Green products;Education;Employment","","","","37","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the flexibility of canopies, the computation of parachute aerodynamics is a key issue in dynamic modeling. Different from the rigid aircraft, there is a strong interaction between the parachute and its surrounding fluid. Base on the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) method, inflation behavior of a Disk-Gap-Band parachute is investigated firstly. In this way, the lift and drag coefficients are generated. Then, the dynamic model in the terminal falling of a PWS is established based on the obtained aerodynamic parameters. The impact point prediction is accomplished by analyzing the dynamic characteristics. Besides, a numerical simulation airdrop platform is developed accordingly. Finally, the proposed method is verified by airdrop-testing. To conclude, the results show that the modeling methods in inflation and terminal descent are effective to forecast the landing area of the PWS, which will be useful for airdrop missions.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6390-3","10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9188479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9188479","Parachute-warhead system;inflating process;impact point prediction;multibody dynamics","Aerodynamics;Vehicle dynamics;Mathematical model;Atmospheric modeling;Predictive models;Couplings;Fluids","","2","","26","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the primary purpose of this study is to delve into the integration of poetry and Artificial Intelligence into the STEAM teaching method. The research objectives which guide this study are to understand the methods and depth of including poetry in STEAM and evaluate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance poetry's role in STEAM. Using the PRISMA methodology, an extensive search was conducted in key databases such as Scopus and Google Scholar. This search identified 26 crucial papers, then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Current STEAM teaching approaches focus on merging literary expressions with essential scientific disciplines. A large part of the findings points to new teaching methods that bring together poetic elements and the usual STEAM subjects. These methods increase student participation, bridge the gap between arts and sciences and encourage creative problem-solving. In the realm of STEAM education, the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing. The findings suggest that AI can boost teaching methods centred on poetry in STEAM. AI allows for lesson adjustments based on students' engagement with poetry, creates platforms for more student participation, and offers feedback to help educators improve their teaching methods. However, there are challenges in merging the exactness of AI algorithms with the complexities of poetry, especially when trying to maintain poetry's essence.

Impact assessment plays an important role in this protection, which provides real-time situations for security managers. The assessment of CIs not only need to analyze the cyberattack's impact on any specific station, but also to consider the spreading process of the negative impact. However, few research in this domain consider the above two aspects simultaneously due to the complexity of CIs and their operation. To tackle this problem, a hierarchical flow model (HFM)-based impact assessment is presented. In this approach, a novel HFM method is proposed to describe a system from a function system perspective, which combines a flow model and hierarchical knowledge. By using this method, a CI model which considers cyber-physical interaction within a station, dependence among stations, and the topological structure of the physical network is established. Next, based on the CI model, an impact assessment is proposed to quantify the loss which is caused by the impact spreading within the CI network.

New emerging artificial intelligence tools (AIT) are released to the public and are gaining momentum with a growing debate about the possible negative and positive effects of these new tools on students' skills, specifically their emotional intelligence (EI). This article addresses the scarcity of research related to Artificial Intelligence Tools AIT specifically ChatGPT, its possible negative effect on the EI of engineering and non-engineering students, and their level of EI. We built an online questionnaire that we shared electronically with students worldwide on the Facebook platform and in classrooms by uni-versity professors. We used Wong and Law's WLEIS self-report emotional intelligence scale and adapted it for our research. Most answers received are from Tunisia and Hungary. The findings demonstrate that students who study engineering tend to have lower emotional intelligence (EI) than non-engineering students. Additionally, the use of ChatGPT appears to have a somewhat detrimental impact on students' EI abilities, regardless of whether or not they have any concerns regarding artificial intelligence technology (AIT). However, it should be noted that students are still utilizing ChatGPT for both personal and academic purposes","","979-8-3503-7177-2","10.1109/ICIET60671.2024.10542830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10542830","Artificial Intelligence Tools;Emotional Intelligence;Education;Intercultural Competence;quantitative method","Privacy;Social networking (online);Education;Medical services;Chatbots;Security;Artificial intelligence","","","","25","IEEE","5 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper will delve in some detail to consider just how the landscape of storytelling has changed with the invention of new and advanced AI technologies, changing the nature of engaging tales as literature has otherwise always been carried out. This is one of those studies among them, “The Turing Test for Literature,” which examines the question of whether the leading AI is driving the traditional concept of authorship and human creativity into an even more subtle question. Underlining the discussion is the concept of the Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in the year 1950 as one of the methods to determine a machine’s intelligence. The test was originally designed to test whether AI could engage in conversation like humans. Although that offers a good stage for using the possibility that AI-authored literature would be undistinguished in plots and characters from human-authored ones, it remains likely that a great deal of literature could pass for being authored by humans. It is from this premise that questions, therefore, arise and call for an examination of AI-produced texts from human-authored works, parallels, differentials, and implications against the future of storytelling. The impact of AI extends to narrative construction in a manner that is beyond simple automation; it has an influence on the very nature of the creative process. Such linguistic competencies and stylistic finesse, which AI systems can “learn” and be fine-tuned to, come through the use of algorithms enabling large corpus text analysis and allow the systems to relate compelling stories.","","979-8-3503-6016-5","10.1109/ICACITE60783.2024.10616700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10616700","Artificial Intelligence;Literature;Narrative;Character Development;Turing Test;Authorship;Creativity;Ethical Implications;Computational Analysis;Stakeholder Engagement","Ethics;Technological innovation;Text analysis;Sensitivity;Oral communication;Linguistics;Complexity theory","","","","50","IEEE","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
