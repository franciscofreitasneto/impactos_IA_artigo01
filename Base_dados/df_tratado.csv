In emerging markets, artificial intelligence and intelligent technologies are, in fact, an integral part of cutting-edge management systems. They add to the globalization of business by providing quick access to employees, customers, and partners worldwide, as well as coordinating global interaction between companies at different stages of the value chain. It does not mean that intelligent technologies and systems simply increase the efficiency of a company's operations; they can be considered as a key intangible asset. The AI strategy is defined as a set of coordinated policies that have a clear objective of maximizing the potential benefits and minimizing the potential costs of AI for the economy and society. In the past few years, two dozen countries have launched their national strategies in the field of artificial intelligence. Many countries have already developed their AI strategy at the official level during the last 3 years. The main goal of this paper is the analysis of the emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs) AI strategies to support the emergent economy and identify key AI strategies development directions. The research is based on the analysis of large volumes of information, the author's own experience, and literature review that includes the latest findings in this field. Research Methodology includes a systematic approach, comparative analysis, case-study, and modeling. The problem the author considers here is: How can we reduce the impact of risks and uncertainty on the economic stability with the help of AI and how the emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs)' AI Strategies have already been successfully using the AI Strategies in the past fifteen years? The findings of the research are based on providing a framework for assessing the role of EMNEs' AI strategy and Machine Learning model for EMNE's strategy selection.",wos
polunina o,is artificial intelligence disruptive?,proceedings of the european conference on the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics (eciair 2019),2019,artificial intelligence; Fourth Industrial Revolution; information and psychological security; ICT; malicious use of artificial intelligence,"The paper aims to analyze the risks and hazards of information and psychological security within the framework of the development of artificial intelligence as one of the possible causes of controlled chaos in the modern world. Even today, the social and political basis of many managerial methods are being changed from the point of view of their architecture because of information and communication technologies. In general global information data bases, intellectual analytical systems and information technologies force specialists to deal with absolutely new kinds of decision making and prognostics either in social or political management. The genesis of the main areas of problem management and prognostics is connected as a rule with strict time limits and available media solutions. The paper also considers the problem of the nonstructural nature of modern data and the way that creates an additional challenge for the functioning of various systems. Data hygiene and a new philosophy of data structure are important elements of future advances and far-sighted strategies for most organisations. Big possibilities create big problems. One of them is inequality, but not in the economic sense, but in terms of inequality in the access to information data, to control information data. It actually means that the advantages of the digital revolution, the Fourth Industrial revolution and artificial intelligence development are going to concentrate in the hands of an extremely small percentage of the population. This is dangerous for social and political stability. Under such conditions, the main way to maintain some balance is mutual development, co-operation and dialogue at least in the scientific sphere.",wos

wang j;tian h;zheng ph,the impact of artificial intelligence on corporate environmental investment,ieee transactions on engineering management,2025,Artificial intelligence; Investment; Protection; Companies; Pollution; Economics; Regulation; Pollution measurement; Finance; Green products; environmental investment; financing constraints; information transparency,"As an important driving force for a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, artificial intelligence has great potential in improving corporate investment in environmental protection and promoting economic growth. However, due to data bottlenecks, there is no clear conclusion on how AI impact environmental investment at the enterprise level. Based on the annual report data of Chinese listed companies, we use machine learning methods to generate an artificial intelligence dictionary, and then constructs enterprise-level artificial intelligence indicators. Through empirical research, we find that AI can significantly improve enterprises' environmental investment. After the robustness tests such as the instrumental variable method and the propensity score matching method, the conclusion remains unchanged. Mechanism analysis shows that AI can improve firms' investment in environmental protection by alleviating financing constraints and improving information transparency. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the state-owned attributes, high tax burden and high environmental regulation of enterprises can enhance the correlation between AI and environmental protection investment. Further research finds that the increase in environmental protection investment caused by artificial intelligence can significantly reduce environmental pollution, rather than for the sake of greenwashing behavior. This article not only enriches the relevant research on the impact of corporate environmental protection investment, but also provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to further promote the development of artificial intelligence technology.",wos

pashentsev e,malicious use of artificial intelligence: challenging international psychological security,proceedings of the european conference on the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics (eciair 2019),2019,artificial intelligence; internet; international security; international psychological security; psychological warfare,"This paper analyses new threats to international psychological security (IPS) posed by the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) by aggressive state and non-state actors in international relations. Compared with the positive applications of artificial intelligence (AI), MUAI as related to security threats is a much less-studied area. The paper defines and establishes the IPS domain and provides possible MUAI classifications based on implementability, territorial coverage, degree of damage, and speed and forms of propagation. The author lays out current and prospective MUAI-based threats to IPS: the creation of 'deepfakes', the damage to reputation through bot activities, the setting and amplification of a manipulative agenda, the use of prognostic weapons, etc. Factors that complicate the minimisation of damage caused by state and non-state actors to IPS from MUAI are singled out. This study confirms that MUAI elevates threats to IPS to a qualitatively new level which requires an adequate assessment and reaction from society. There may be different classifications of MUAI threats (including the sphere of IPS). The comprehension of new threats-the number of which will only grow-lags behind the fast-changing realities of the modern world. With the goal of harming society, asocial actors can use AI systems that are rapidly spreading and becoming less expensive. MUAI is particularly dangerous in today's tense international environment when it is easier to manipulate the public consciousness experiencing the powerful impact of negative objective and subjective factors of social development. The methodology for this research is based on a systematic approach to the role of AI in psychological warfare. Comparative analysis and case studies are helpful to obtain findings which offer the basis for the efficiency criterion for MUAI and its neutralisation under unstable dynamic social equilibriums.",wos

AI impact assessments (AI-IAs) are a way of identifying positive and negative impacts early on to safeguard AI's benefits and avoid its downsides. This article describes the first systematic review of these AI-IAs. Working with a population of 181 documents, the authors identified 38 actual AI-IAs and subjected them to a rigorous qualitative analysis with regard to their purpose, scope, organisational context, expected issues, timeframe, process and methods, transparency and challenges. The review demonstrates some convergence between AI-IAs. It also shows that the field is not yet at the point of full agreement on content, structure and implementation. The article suggests that AI-IAs are best understood as means to stimulate reflection and discussion concerning the social and ethical consequences of AI ecosystems. Based on the analysis of existing AI-IAs, the authors describe a baseline process of implementing AI-IAs that can be implemented by AI developers and vendors and that can be used as a critical yardstick by regulators and external observers to evaluate organisations' approaches to AI.",wos
li d;zhang z;gao x,does artificial intelligence deter greenwashing?,finance research letters,2024,Artificial intelligence; Greenwashing; ESG performance; Corporate governance,"Employing 6,940 observations of 1,205 Chinese-listed firms from 2012 to 2022, we provide robust evidence that Artificial Intelligence (hereafter AI) inhibits greenwashing. We further find that AI achieves this effect by mitigating agency problems, easing financing constraints, and increasing external attention. In addition, the positive impact of AI in curbing greenwashing is more notable in politically unaffiliated firms, those with fewer female directors, or those with weaker equity incentives. Our findings highlight AI's crucial role in combating greenwashing and maintaining capital market order.",wos
li ;ma s;qu ;wang jm,the impact of artificial intelligence on firms' energy and resource efficiency: empirical evidence from china,resources policy,2023,Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Total factor productivity; Scale effects; Structural effects; Efficiency effects,"As a strategic technology, artificial intelligence is leading a new round of technological revolution and industrial upgrading that plays an essential role in cultivating emerging industries. This paper employs robot application data compiled by the IFR (International Federation of Robotics) and Chinese firm-level data to empirically investigate the impact of artificial intelligence applications on the energy and resource efficiency of firms. From 2005 to 2014, the energy efficiency of industrial enterprises had an upward trend, and the level of artificial intelligence showed a significant increase in China. Based on our findings, artificial intelligence has a positive and significant impact on improving the energy and resource efficiency of Chinese firms. Controlling for endogeneity issues, the results are robust. Artificial intelligence affects the energy consumption of enterprises through scale, structural, and efficiency effects. Structural and efficiency effects are greater than the impact of scale effects. Therefore, artificial intelligence saves energy consumption and improves energy and resource efficiency. Regarding considerably increasing energy demands, the development of artificial intelligence offers a unique opportunity to improve the energy and resource efficiency of enterprises, thus adjusting the energy and economic structure of a country.",wos

However, since all human activity is governed by law, there is an obvious overlap between artificial intelligence and legal sciences.Therefore, determining the impact of artificial intelligence and new technologies in the workplace was the overall objective of this research. To achieve this objective, descriptive research was conducted to examine the key areas in which artificial intelligence and the law relate to gain a better understanding of how they might be used in practice. In addition, a quantitative approach was used and special emphasis was placed on the respect of workers' rights in the Ecuadorian and Latin American states. In other words, a humanitarian analysis of the use of artificial intelligence in the workplace was carried out. As a result, it was determined that to prevent this vulnerability, technological advancement must go hand in hand with the advancement of workers' rights.Therefore, this study focused on a humanism approach that examines the relationship between two disciplines that is dynamic and constantly changing in social reality.The rationale behind this approach will be discussed below.",wos

Societies, governments, and business organizations need to view artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their usage from an entirely different perspective. AI is poised to have a tremendous impact on every aspect of our lives. Therefore, it must have a broader view that transcends AI's technical capabilities and perceived value, including areas of AI's impact and influence. Nicholas G. Carr's seminal paper IT Does not Matter (Carr, 2003) explained how IT's potential and ubiquity have increased, but IT's strategic importance has declined with time. AI is poised to meet the same fate as IT. In fact, the commoditization of AI has already begun. This paper presents the arguments to demonstrate that AI is moving rapidly in this direction. It also proposes an artificial intelligence-based organizational framework to gain value-added elements for lowering the impact of AI commoditization.",wos

Nevertheless, capturing the productivity gains stemming from artificial intelligence in macro-level data poses challenges, leading to the question of whether artificial intelligence is reminiscent of the Solow paradox. This study employs micro-level manufacturing data to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence on firms' productivity. The study finds that every 1% increase in artificial intelligence penetration can lead to a 14.2% increase in total factor productivity. This conclusion remains robust even after conducting endogeneity analysis and a series of robustness tests. The study identifies that the positive impact of artificial intelligence on productivity is primarily achieved through the value-added enhancement effect, skill-biased enhancement effect, and technology upgrading effect. Furthermore, the study reveals that the effects of artificial intelligence on productivity vary across different property rights and industry concentration contexts. Additionally, the structure of factor endowments within firms can also influence the productivity gains from artificial intelligence. Our study presents compelling evidence demonstrating the role of artificial intelligence in fostering economic sustainability within the framework of Industry 4.0.",wos

And if we at least have learnt (but in fact we have not) how to build relationships with people around us, the relations within the paradigm of IoT are different, to put it mildly. The fact that there are more devices connected to the internet than people, or that these devices are able to communicate themselves not involving people, still seems unusual and exotic. In the sphere of the development of artificial intelligence (AI), things are far too complicated. To start with, AI has always been a controversial idea since it was first proposed. Ambitious goals and scientific challenges have attracted scientists from different fields. They started to conduct research with varying perspectives, interests and motivations, from mysteries of human thought to the design of intelligent, thinking machines. In other words, there has always been a controversy between conducting fundamental research and creating a functional device. What's more, most people are not familiar with the concept of AI. Quite a vivid example came from the USA: only 17% of senior business leaders out of 1,500 who were asked in 2017 were familiar with the concept, despite the fact that AI is penetrating and/or transforming every sphere of our life. These changes on one hand, and the lack of clear and understandable information on the other, are the main causes of the thriving myths and anxiety around the development of AI. The proposed paper addresses such issues as the popular myths around AI and their origin and aims at debunking them. However, while we are caught up with the myths, AI is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy and governments. In this paper we will discuss highly likely risk scenarios in order to understand the chain of events, think of effective strategies and optimise the efforts.",wos
chen m;qi ;wu x,applications of artificial intelligence in oceanic nuclear contamination management,"2024 ieee conference on artificial intelligence, cai 2024",2024,Artificial Intelligence; Oceanic Nuclear Contamination,"Recently, nuclear pollution in the ocean has become a hot debate. The unprecedented advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has engendered practical applications for addressing environmental issues such as nuclear contamination in oceans. AI algorithms and applications have been widely studied in multiple scientific fields, however, the research on marine science, especially oceanic nuclear contamination is limited. To fill in the gap in the related field, this paper introduces four major categories of AI technologies in oceanic nuclear contamination management, explores their applications in six companies/institutions across three leading countries, and compares the similarity and differences among them. It is found that UK, Japan, and China mainly use robots or drones for nuclear contamination management, and rely heavily on state fundings and the scientific output from research institutions. On the other hand, different countries have various objectives and motivations to drive AI in this area. What is more, we found that although most traditional big IT companies have not clearly stated the usage of AI in marine pollution, the need to diminish the impacts of nuclear pollution in oceans will inevitably urge new applications of AI in oceanic nuclear contamination.",wos

According to the report, AI significantly improves the industrial sector's GVC position; this finding still holds after multiple robustness and endogeneity tests of the model. The findings of the heterogeneity test at the national level demonstrate that, in developing nations as opposed to developed countries, AI has a stronger impact on advancing the GVC position of the manufacturing industry. Heterogeneity tests at the industry level show that AI has a significant role in promoting the GVC of high, medium and low technology manufacturing industries. The mechanism test demonstrates three primary ways by which AI contributes to improving the GVC position of the manufacturing industry: by improving both production efficiency and technological innovation capacity, and by reducing trade costs. This study provides policy implications for the promotion of AI with respect to China's manufacturing industry GVC position.",wos

This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence on workplace safety by applying Heinrich's domino theory. Using empirical data from listed companies in China from 2011 to 2022, we find that artificial intelligence will improve workplace safety. We attribute this to the fact that artificial intelligence reduces employees' unsafe behavior and suppresses the unsafe state of objects, which in turn promotes workplace safety. In addition, we find that military CEOs enhance the relationship, but foreign shareholders have no effect on it. Further tests show that the role of artificial intelligence in improving workplace safety is more pronounced in SOEs and firms that disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR).

The article studies the influence of artificial intelligence on green economic growth and its mechanism. The research shows that (1) artificial intelligence can promote green economic growth in China. After accounting for spatial factors, it was found that artificial intelligence could promote local green economic growth, but had a siphon effect on neighboring green economic growth. From the perspective of dynamic effects, in the short term, artificial intelligence will not significantly dampen green economic growth in neighboring regions. In the long run, artificial intelligence will have a stronger role in promoting green economic growth, and the siphon effect on neighboring cities will be more significant. (2) As the level of human capital increases, the negative spillover effect of artificial intelligence will be significantly weakened. The promotion effect of artificial intelligence on green economic growth is relatively weak in resource-based cities.

In recent years, agenda setting has been influenced more and more powerfully by rapidly developing AI technologies. The news production process, the collection, processing, and analysis of information, the production of photo and video materials, storytelling, and news distribution are increasingly affected by these algorithms. AI is also widely used in searches for broadcast content, content production and management. Snackable video services, automated caption generation, topic-based profile enrichment, AI news anchors, the creation of new programs through the mining of archives and even the automated studio system utilizing the power of AI and that does not require camera people or an onsite director. The implementation of AI in agenda setting is reducing costs and boosting revenues both to the media industry itself and to its customers. At the same time, due to the crisis in the world economy, the degradation of democratic institutions in many countries, and increasingly acute geopolitical rivalries, there is a growing trend towards the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) through agenda setting at the national and global levels. Reactionary regimes can focus the entire range of AI technologies on agenda setting in order to keep populations under their control and to pursue psychological aggression against other nations, thereby turning agenda setting into an important element of hybrid warfare. Self-interest in terms of making money by any means can also turn some global information resources, not least social networks, into dangerous MUAI tools. The current paper focuses on the following issues: the role of AI in the provision of agenda setting, the social and political context, and the technologies, current practices and implications of MUAI in shaping the important issues of the day. Specific recommendations are offered for minimizing the damage from MUAI and organizing international cooperation to counter such practices.

This ethical dimension, derived from the underlying code and training data, shapes the recommendations given, behaviors exhibited, and perceptions had by AI. These factors influence how AI is regulated, used, misused, and impacts end-users. The multifaceted nature of AI's influence has sparked extensive discussions across disciplines like Science and Technology Studies (STS), Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) studies, public policy analysis, and responsible innovation-underscoring the need to examine AI's ethical ramifications. While the initial wave of AI ethics focused on articulating principles and guidelines, recent scholarship increasingly emphasizes the practical implementation of ethical principles, regulatory oversight, and mitigating unforeseen negative consequences. Drawing from the concept of ethics dumping in research ethics, this paper argues that practices surrounding AI development and deployment can, unduly and in a very concerning way, offload ethical responsibilities from developers and regulators to ill-equipped users and host environments. Four key trends illustrating such ethics dumping are identified: (1) AI developers embedding ethics through coded value assumptions, (2) AI ethics guidelines promoting broad or unactionable principles disconnected from local contexts, (3) institutions implementing AI systems without evaluating ethical implications, and (4) decision-makers enacting ethical governance frameworks disconnected from practice. Mitigating AI ethics dumping requires empowering users, fostering stakeholder engagement in norm-setting, harmonizing ethical guidelines while allowing flexibility for local variation, and establishing clear accountability mechanisms across the AI ecosystem.",wos

Methods: A targeted, non-systematic review of the published literature relating to colorectal cancer diagnosis was performed with PubMed databases that were scouted to help provide a more defined understanding of the recent advances regarding artificial intelligence and their impact on colorectal-related morbidity and mortality. Articles were included if deemed relevant and including information associated with the keywords. Results: The advancements in artificial intelligence have been significant in facilitating an earlier diagnosis of CRC. In this review, we focused on evaluating genomic biomarkers, the integration of instruments with artificial intelligence, MR and hyperspectral imaging, and the architecture of neural networks. We found that these neural networks seem practical and yield positive results in initial testing. Furthermore, we explored the use of deep-learning-based majority voting methods, such as bag of words and PAHLI, in improving diagnostic accuracy in colorectal cancer detection. Alongside this, the autonomous and expansive learning ability of artificial intelligence, coupled with its ability to extract increasingly complex features from images or videos without human reliance, highlight its impact in the diagnostic sector. Despite this, as most of the research involves a small sample of patients, a diversification of patient data is needed to enhance cohort stratification for a more sensitive and specific neural model. We also examined the successful application of artificial intelligence in predicting microsatellite instability, showcasing its potential in stratifying patients for targeted therapies. Conclusions: Since its commencement in colorectal cancer, artificial intelligence has revealed a multitude of functionalities and augmentations in the diagnostic sector of CRC. Given its early implementation, its clinical application remains a fair way away, but with steady research dedicated to improving neural architecture and expanding its applicational range, there is hope that these advanced neural software could directly impact the early diagnosis of CRC.

For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT's distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs' exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.",wos

While much of the previous research focused on the macroeconomic impact of AI, this study examined how AI technology affects food processing firm performance, productivity, and labor skill structure at the food processing firm level. This study utilized panel data from listed food processing enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen spanning from 2010 to 2021, performing textual analysis on the annual reports of listed companies and then creating enterprise-level AI indicators to empirically examine the influence of AI applications on enterprise performance and its underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate a substantial improvement in business performance due to the application of artificial intelligence, which is a conclusion corroborated through a series of stability tests. Exploring channels and mechanisms, the analysis revealed that AI-driven advancements in production technologies stimulated the requirement for highly skilled labor, thereby inducing shifts in the labor force's structure. Further investigation demonstrated that artificial intelligence contributed to enhancing the total factor productivity, consequently bolstering the overall enterprise performance. A heterogeneity analysis showed that firm-level factors, such as the nature of property rights and factor intensity, had an impact on the influence of AI on firm performance. In addition, the geographic location and time of year of a company also had impacts on the productivity benefits of artificial intelligence.

This study utilises the wavelet-based QQR methodology to seize the dynamic correlation of artificial intelligence index (AII) and electric vehicle indicator (EVI). Based on quantitative deliberations, the favourable effects of AII on EVI at low-low and high-high quantiles and adverse impacts at high-low and low-high quantiles in the short run confirm the role of artificial intelligence in facilitating the electric vehicle market. However, the favourable effect of AII at medium to high quantiles on EVI at low quantiles refutes it because of the crowding-out effect. Conversely, the positive impact of EVI at medium to high quantiles on AII at low to medium quantiles ascertains the crowdingout effect of electric vehicles, while AII at medium to high quantiles cannot agree on it due to safety and convenience needs. In the mid-to-long term, the interactions of AII and EVI are gradually weakened, and speculative behaviours, crowding-out effects, and safety concerns drive the different cases. Therefore, a win-win situation between them does not always hold, and recommendations are being offered to enhance the significance of artificial intelligence in electric vehicles under the new round of scientific and technological revolution.",wos

Previous research has failed to consider the short-, medium-, and long-term variations in AI's impact on unemployment, which may lead to an incomplete understanding of the AI-employment relationship. This paper examines daily data from January 4, 2013, to August 12, 2024, utilising advanced wavelet-based Quantile on Quantile Regression (QQR) methodology to assess AI's impact on the Unemployment Index (UI) across quantiles and time scales, with a sample size of 2820 drawn from a larger dataset totalling 4241 observations. The conclusions reveal that AI generally positively impacts UI in the short term, especially with AI at 0.6-0.7 quantiles, as automation replaces workers faster than new job roles emerge and skills transform. However, in the medium term, positive and negative effects balance as new jobs and skills emerge through continuous industrial restructuring. In the long run, AI predominantly mitigates UI by further enhancing economic development, fostering skill upgrading, and facilitating market adjustments, but this result does not hold during AI at 0.7 quantiles and UI at the highest quantiles, such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Mismanagement of natural resources is thought to be essential in growing natural resource curse and, as a result, decreasing the value addition of sustainable products, contributing to unsustainable development. Artificial intelligence, along with other factors, has emerged as a major driver of output and value addition. The present study investigates the asymmetric role of artificial intelligence and natural resource management on sustainable export value embedment over the period 1980-2020 for China's economy using the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. The results of the study validate the asymmetric association between artificial intelligence and sustainable export value addition. Similarly, an asymmetric relationship exists between natural resource management and the value of sustainable export. Further, the dynamic multiplier analysis advocates that the effect of negative shock in artificial intelligence is dominant whereas the impact of positive shock in natural resource management is influential on increasing sustainable export value addition. Therefore, our study concludes that policymaking on the assumption of concerned symmetric impacts is misleading. Lastly, our study suggests that policymakers may strive for high growth trends and refrain from the decline in artificial intelligence and natural resource management so that stipulated sustainable value addition can be obtained.",wos

ChatGPT's generative capabilities and versatility across technical and creative domains led to its widespread adoption, marking a departure from more limited deployments of previous AI systems. While society grapples with the emerging cultural impacts of this new societal-scale technology, critiques of ChatGPT's impact within machine learning research communities have coalesced around its performance or other conventional safety evaluations relating to bias, toxicity, and hallucination. We argue that these critiques draw heavily on a particular conceptualization of the human-centered framework, which tends to cast atomized individuals as the key recipients of technology's benefits and detriments. In this article, we direct attention to another dimension of LLMs and dialogue agents' impact: their effects on social groups, institutions, and accompanying norms and practices. By analyzing ChatGPT's social impact through a social-centered framework, we challenge individualistic approaches in AI development and contribute to ongoing debates around the ethical and responsible deployment of AI systems. We hope this effort will call attention to more comprehensive and longitudinal evaluation tools (e.g., including more ethnographic analyses and participatory approaches) and compel technologists to complement human-centered thinking with social-centered approaches.",wos

This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with âwhether AI assistance was used to complete the paperâ as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students' use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories.

Firstly, research has found that AIGC tools can quickly generate a large number of creative concepts and design drafts, providing designers with more sources of inspiration. The use of this tool can stimulate the creative thinking of designers, making it easier for them to try different design styles and element combinations. However, at the same time, some designers have also raised concerns that AIGC may weaken their creative output, as excessive reliance on these tools may lead to a decrease in designer creativity. Secondly, this study emphasizes the role of AIGC tools in the design process. They can not only be used for creative inspiration, but also for automated repetitive tasks, allowing designers to focus more on creative and strategic work. This division of labor and collaboration approach provides designers with more time to think, explore, and advance design projects, which helps to improve the quality of creative thinking. In summary, AIGC driven graphic design tools have played an important role in stimulating creative thinking among designers, but there are also some challenges. Designers need to recognize the advantages and limitations of AIGC tools and integrate them into their creative process to achieve more innovative and in-depth design works. This study provides a deep understanding of the application of AIGC in the field of graphic design and valuable insights for future research and practice.

kumar t;kait r;ankit;malik a ,the role of generative artificial intelligence (gai) in education: a detailed review for enhanced learning experiences,lecture notes in electrical engineering,2024,Accessible education; Education; Generative artificial intelligence (GAI); Intelligent tutoring; Personalized learning; Transformative impact,"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including education, has emerged due to rapid artificial intelligence (AI) breakthroughs. This article examines the general function of GAI in education and how it alters the nature of learning experiences. This paper explores the use of GAI in personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and accessible education through a thorough literature review and analysis. Personalized learning experiences are made possible by GAIâs capacity to analyze sizable amounts of data about specific students. GAI may modify educational content and instructional procedures to suit each studentâs needs by taking into account each oneâs individual learning preferences, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and progress. This personalized method encourages involvement, greater comprehension, and higher learning results. The crucial function that GAI plays in education also includes intelligent tutoring. GAI offers pupils specialized training, criticism, and direction as a virtual tutor. Depending on the studentâs needs, it can provide answers, clarify complex topics, and give more resources. The most effective and efficient educational support is offered to pupils thanks to GAIâs adaptive teaching methods and real-time changes. GAI also has the potential to deal with the problem of accessible education. GAI-powered online platforms can offer access to top-notch education in outlying regions or underserved communities. The accessibility and scalability of GAI enable the distribution of instructional content to people without physical access to conventional educational institutions. This inclusiveness encourages equitable learning opportunities and lessens educational inequities. Although the potential for the abstract use of GAI in education is enormous, there are still issues that need to be resolved, including those related to ethics, privacy, and the requirement for human oversight. This article adds to the continuing conversation about the use of GAI in education and emphasizes how it has a transformative effect on improving learning opportunities.

Literature suggests that educators and researchers have many varied concerns regarding student assessment in the higher education GenAI context, such as how to assess studentsâ learning and the new (refocused) learning outcomes that emerged in GenAI-facilitated learning environments. To provide evidence-based insights into and answers to these concerns, we conducted a scoping review by collating literature in relevant research areas. Following a five-stage scoping review framework, we collaboratively collected and coded 34 studies. The three assessment approaches identified in the review were traditional assessment, innovative and refocused assessment and GenAI-incorporated assessment. The new, refocused learning outcomes identified were career-driven competencies and lifelong learning skills. The review also revealed that most research designs were qualitatively oriented (e.g., with exploratory design, descriptive research, ethnographic research and phenomenological research). This study proposes a holistic diagram showing the current research status and trends. It suggests five future research directions: innovative assessment designs, collaborations among assessment approaches, new learning outcomes, relationships between assessment approaches and learning outcomes, and quantitative or mixed research studies. Implications for practice or policy: â¢ Traditional assessment methods in higher education do not operate effectively in the GenAI era. â¢ Innovative and refocused assessment and GenAI-incorporated assessment are promising strategies to assess student learning. â¢ Career-driven competencies and lifelong learning skills are new focused learning outcomes evolved from the use of GenAI. â¢ More quantitative and mixed research studies should be conducted to provide additional empirical evidence on the impact of GenAI on student assessment and learning outcomes.

However, most of these GenAI applications require a subscription to access the most advanced models and functionalities. Therefore, the search for cost-effective solutions becomes an important concern, especially for instructors and educational institutions with limited resources. This article introduces a Web Application aimed at facilitating instructors in fine-tuning open-source LLMs and subsequently posing questions to them. Instructors only need to upload a dataset into the Web Application to fine-tune the open-source LLM, specifically Llama 2. This web application was developed using open-source tools (Hugging Face and Langchain), and techniques to reduce hardware resource consumption (LoRA and QLoRA). Preliminary results from the experiments conducted show that LLMs provide more accurate responses when fine-tuned for a specific task through the Web Application. These are the first steps in providing cost-effective GenAI solutions for instructors and educational institutions using open-source tools.

mozelius p ,generative ai and its impact on activities and assessment in higher education: some recommendations from master's students,"proceedings of the 4th international conference on ai research, icair 2024",2024,Artificial intelligence; GenAI; Generative AI; Higher education; Sustainable education,"The rapid development of generative AI (GenAI) raises new questions in higher education such as: What should be the university policy regarding GenAI? How ought courses be redesigned for fair and resilient assessment? What the added pedagogical and didactical values when involving GenAI in teaching and learning activities? Different universities have rapidly created and presented contradictory standpoints and draft policies, and teachers show different opinions regarding the pros and cons of GenAI. This study has been carried out with a student perspective, where 16 students have been examining their own Master's programme on sustainable information provision. Students have assessed the assessment in their previous courses in the Master's programme. The aim of the study is to investigate how sustainable course activities and assignment are, and to explore how GenAI tools might support and facilitate teaching and learning activities. Moreover, the students were given the task to test detection software on GenAI generated solutions to assignments in chosen Master's courses. Students conducted these tasks as a part of a 7.5 ECTS project course in the same Master's programme as the investigated courses are a part of. For inspiration and for background information on artificial intelligence to the project work students participated in the first Symposium on AI Opportunities and Challenges (SAIOC) in December 2023. Data have been gathered from reports of 3 group projects where 16 students have investigated 5 freely chosen courses in the programme in each group work. Beside from testing GenAI tools in existing activities and assignments students also interviewed the subject matter experts that are responsible for the chosen courses. Results were firstly analysed and presented in group reports, combined with 16 individual reflection essays. Regarding the individual essays students were instructed to bring up ethical perspectives on GenAI in higher education, and also to present and discuss suggestions for how the current course design and assignments better could be redesigned for improved sustainability and fairness. Finally, all the group reports and the individual reflection essays were thematically analysed by the author, who also is the subject matter expert and main teacher for the project course. Findings show that many of the existing assignments in the Master's programme could be partly solved with different GenAI tools. The AI generated solutions showed different levels of quality and correctness for different types of activities and assignments. An ethical concern that many student essays brought up was the relatively poor quality of the tested detection software. A question in one of the essays was if teachers should use detection software with an accuracy rate just above 50% to evaluate student submissions. The recommendations from both the students and the author are to provide clear instructions about when GenAI is allowed and not in course activities, and to redesign the course structure for continuous assessment. With or without GenAI tools, a continuous assessment where the whole study path through a course is assessed, and not only isolated submissions, would strengthen fairness and sustainability. Finally, several students suggest oral examinations as a complement to the existing assessment methods, even if their findings showed that GenAI tools can be used to prepare oral presentations.

Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. As a result, assessment reform has become a pressing topic in the GenAI era. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from âno AIâ to âfull AI, â enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking. The pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI and enhanced student engagement with GenAI technology.

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachersâ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in Kâ12 settings.

This instance involves the identification of fraudulent content, which is often characterized by dynamic patterns, in addition to content production. The generated contents are constrained, which limits their dimensionality. In this scenario, duplicated contents are eliminated from the automatic creations. Furthermore, the generated ratios are utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors, hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios. These scenarios involve generating large patterns and reducing the dynamic patterns with an enhanced accuracy of 97% in the projected model. This is in contrast to the existing approach, which only provides a content accuracy of 77% after detecting fraud. Â© 2024 The Author(s). Expert Systems published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",scopus

The various AIGC identification methods studied in this paper are of great significance to prevent the negative impact of rapidly evolving generated artificial intelligence. [Design/Methodology] This paper first constructed a HAC data set in multiple online community platforms with 54 major categories of topics of Sina Weibo, which contained 100,873 pieces of information written by humans and generated artificial intelligence respectively. Then it explored whether the current 6 kinds of mainstream deep learning and 7 kinds of machine learning methods can identify whether the information in the online community was written by human beings or generated by artificial intelligence. Finally, the BEM-RCNN method was proposed to further improve the recognition of AIGC precision. [Findings/ Conclusion] From the perspective of constructed data set, it is found that generated artificial intelligence has a strong ""human-like expression"", which can simulate human beings to post and reply on social media platforms. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has an accuracy of 96.4%, which can well identify whether the content on the online community is written by humans or AI. It is superior to the 13 other mainstream methods such as BERT, ERNIE, and TextRNN in terms of precision, recall rate, F1-value, and accuracy, verifying its performance advantages. At the same time, many exploratory experiments have also proved that although the current mainstream machine learning methods are less accurate than the method in this paper, they can also be competent for some AIGC recognition tasks.

There is worry that generative AI (GAI) might negatively impact students' creativity. To explore this, we investigated how incorporating image-generative AI in the conceptual design phases of a CAD course affects creativity. We created a curriculum that includes an in-class workshop on using the Midjourney tool for design and a homework assignment where students use GAI to create a mood board for a practical design experience. This curriculum was tested with 20 students from a human-centered design department at a research-intensive university. To evaluate the impact of GAI on creativity, we compared student-created mood boards with and without GAI, which were evaluated by two design experts, and gathered their opinions on GAI and creativity through an open-text survey question. We also used a Creativity Support Index and interviews to get deeper insights into GAI's effect on their creative process. Most students felt that GAI enhanced their creativity via quick idea-to-image iterations in the design process, even though experts saw no significant difference in their artifacts. Additionally, while many found GAI enjoyable to use, they also felt it limited their ability to express their ideas fully. This study provides important insights into how GAI can be integrated into CAD education and implies future directions for AI-supported design tools.

However, concerns about their potential negative impacts have emerged within the academic community. To solve the debate, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of how GAI tools influence the learning process and outcomes. Drawing upon the Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST), this study investigates the impacts of two types of GAI usage namely exploitative and explorative use on two kinds of learning performance (e.g., routine and innovative learning performance) through two opposite mechanisms. On the one hand, through positive reinforcement process, GAI use can improve learning performance by increasing studentsâ routine and creative self-efficacy. On the other hand, through the negative reinforcement process, GAI use may reduce learning performance by increasing technology dependence and deskilling. A survey of 306 GAI users was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses, and the results suggest that (1) both explorative and exploitative use positively influence routine and creative self-efficacy which in turn have positive impacts on routine and innovative performance, (2) both explorative and exploitative use positively influence technology dependence which positively affects routine and innovative performance, and (3) GAI use has no significant direct effect on deskilling but an indirect effect on deskilling through technology dependence and deskilling negatively influences innovative performance.

Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.

su h;tong y;zhang x;fan y ,uncovering studentsâ processing tactics towards chatgptâs feedback in efl education using learning analytics,lecture notes in computer science (including subseries lecture notes in artificial intelligence and lecture notes in bioinformatics),2024,Artificial Intelligence; ChatGPT; Feedback; Learning Analytics; Processing Tactics,"ChatGPT, a promising chatbot program based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI), shows significant promise for its potential use in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. By engaging in dialogue with students, it provides personalized support for their reading and writing, which are fundamental aspects of EFL instruction. Although research on studentsâ interaction with ChatGPT is emerging, there is a lack of focus on their Processing Tactic towards ChatGPTâs Feedback (PTCF) and its impact on learning outcomes. To mitigate this gap, we employed a learning analytic method combining cluster analysis and process mining to analyze multimodal data generated during their reading and writing tasks. The analysis identified three clusters of studentsâ PTCF: (1) Silence with no response, (2) Passive dependence, and (3) Active construction. By conducting sequence analysis on these behavior patterns, it was found that learners adopted three learning modes when using ChatGPT, which are Comprehension-focused, Tool-inspired, and Thinking-alienator. The findings also revealed differences in learning gains among groups of students with varying learning modes, specifically in the improvement of domain knowledge. Implications of these findings for both practical application and future research were also discussed later.

Since November 2022, with the emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this end, a systematic review has been carried out of both the tools and the scientific production that has emerged in the six months since the appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many of the problems associated with these technologies in educational contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our teaching practice.

Employing ChatGPT to assist with marking written assessment presents multiple advantages including scalability, improved consistency, eliminating biases associated with human subjectivity. This work aimed to evaluate the usefulness, reliability and accuracy of ChatGPT in marking written assessments of varied types and to identify its limitations and challenges. ChatGPT was instructed using a set of prompts to mark the assessment based on a rubric. ChatGPT was able to evaluate and assess both coding and reflective assessments and to distinguish between assignments of different quality, demonstrating high consistency and accuracy for higher quality assessments, comparable to a human marking. ChatGPT was also able to generate textual detailed justifications based on the rubric and assessment task description. There was a significant difference in the outcomes generated by different prompts. These preliminary findings suggest that utilising ChatGPT as a marking assistant can increase written assessment marking efficiency, reduce cost and potentially decrease the unfairness and bias by providing a moderating perspective. Implications for practice or policy: â¢ Assessment designers could reconsider the design, purpose and objectives of written assessments and leverage ChatGPT effectively for teaching and learning. â¢ Assessors might consider adapting the technology as a grading aid, to support a human-in-the-loop grading process, providing additional resources and time, moderating and refining individual feedback, to increase consistency and quality. â¢ Curriculum and programme leaders could develop guidelines around the ethical use of generative AI-assisted assessment practice, monitor and regulate the ongoing evaluation and refinement.

This study aims to investigate the impact of a family-centered care (FCC) system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms on the healing of CLLW. A FCC for Childrenâs CLLWs (CLLW FCC) system was designed, consisting primarily of four components: an interaction layer, a service layer, a data layer, and a hardware layer. The CNN algorithm was utilized to establish a segmentation method for chronic wound images, which was then applied to the wound management section of the CLLW FCC system, aiming to improve the nursing outcomes of children with CLLW, optimize wound management processes, and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image processing and analysis. It focused on 92 pediatric patients with CLLW admitted to our hospital from January 2022 to June 2023. The patients were randomly assigned into a control (Con) group and an observation (Obs) group, with 46 cases in each. Patients in the Con group received routine care, while those in the Obs group received FCC system for CLLW. The wound infection rate (WIR), wound healing time (WHT), wound pain scores, parental knowledge scores, and satisfaction with care (SWC) were evaluated for both the Con and Obs groups. The results unveiled that the optimized CNN algorithm achieved mean intersection over union (mIOU) and Kappa values of 0.8965 and 0.8773, respectively, which were higher than those of other algorithms. Patients in the Obs group experienced a shorter WHT and lower wound pain scores in contrast to those in the Con group ( $P\lt 0.05$ ).
